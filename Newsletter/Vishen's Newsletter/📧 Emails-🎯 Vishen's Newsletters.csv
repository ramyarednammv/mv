How to Improve Your Brain and Gain Focus

The Day My Brain Humbled Me
Let me take you back a couple of years. It was shortly after I recovered from COVID. I had just walked into Dr. Daniel Amen’s brain clinic in Southern California, feeling like a rockstar.
Why? Because I had proof I was in amazing health.
At 46, my biological age test came back as… drumroll, please… 20 years old! My Glycanage results were so good I half-expected Dr. Amen to scan my brain and say something like:
""Vishen, we’ve never seen a brain this exceptional. You’re like the Einstein of 2020s biohackers.""
But what I got instead was a harsh dose of reality.
“Vishen,” Dr. Amen said, “your brain is aging faster than your body. You’ve got the brain of someone in their fifties.”
Hold on. What?
My jaw practically hit the floor. How could this be possible? My body was thriving! I was practicing HIIT, meditating, and following a solid diet.
But my brain? It was underperforming.
Dr. Amen explained a few potential causes. COVID was still wreaking havoc on my system, for one. But then he mentioned something else that stuck with me: “You might want to stop drinking alcohol.”
Now, let me confess something. I wasn’t exactly a heavy drinker—just four glasses of wine a week. But I couldn’t shake his words. Could even a little bit of alcohol be holding my brain back?
That’s when I decided to take matters into my own hands.
The 4-Week Experiment That Changed My Life
When I got back to Europe, I decided to make some changes. I didn’t wait for Monday. I didn’t tell myself, “I’ll start next month.”
I went all in.
For the next four weeks, I cut out alcohol completely. No wine, no champagne, not even a celebratory toast at a dinner party.
I also revamped my diet. Inspired by the WildFit protocol, I stuck to a strict regimen of meat, veggies, and whole foods. No sugar. No processed snacks. Just pure, nourishing fuel for my body and brain.
I’ll be honest—it wasn’t easy. Those first few days were rough. I missed my evening glass of wine. I craved sweets after meals. But something magical happened around the one-week mark.
My focus started improving.
And I don’t mean a little. I mean dramatically.
- Tasks that used to take hours suddenly flew by.
- I felt sharp, alert, and present in every conversation.
- Creative ideas poured out of me like water from a tap.
By the end of the four weeks, I felt like a different person. My productivity was off the charts, my mind felt alive, and I realized something important: I’d only scratched the surface.
Six Months Later: A Brain Reborn
That four-week experiment turned into a six-month alcohol-free journey. No exceptions. And let me tell you—the transformation was nothing short of miraculous.
Not only was my focus at an all-time high, but I also noticed a ripple effect across every area of my life.
- I was more present with my family.
- My creativity surged to levels I hadn’t experienced in years.
- Tasks that once felt overwhelming became almost effortless.
At work, I reached new heights of productivity. What used to take me five days now took two and a half. That freed up time to launch new projects, like the Mindvalley States supplement line and the Future Human Festival in Dubai.
And it wasn’t just about cutting out alcohol. Along the way, I discovered a few other brain hacks that supercharged my focus and clarity—and I want to share them with you today.
3 Tools to Reclaim Your Focus and Brain Health
1. Reduce Your Baseline Stress
2. Stress is one of the sneakiest brain killers. It chips away at your focus, creativity, and mental resilience.
The good news? You can rewire your brain to naturally reduce stress. One of the most powerful tools I’ve found is Paul McKenna’s Everyday Bliss Hypnotherapy.
It’s a short audio session available on Mindvalley that rewires your brain to release stress and create a sense of calm. Paul recommends listening to it for seven consecutive days—and trust me, the results are mind-blowing.
I use it regularly to stay grounded, focused, and clear-headed, even during the most hectic weeks.
1. Upgrade Your Brain Chemistry
2. Let’s talk about supplements. I’m not a fan of pharmaceutical solutions that promise focus but come with side effects. Instead, I turned to natural compounds that enhance brain function.
Two standouts:
- Alpha GPC: Boosts cognition and memory.
- Paraxanthine (ParaZanthin): A cleaner caffeine alternative that delivers focus without the jitters.
I loved these so much I worked with my team to create the Mindvalley Focus Pill, combining these compounds with other brain-boosting ingredients. It’s like a shortcut to flow state—natural, effective, and sustainable.
1. Master Your Attention with Nir Eyal
2. Distractions are everywhere. Social media. Endless notifications. That email you “just have to check.”
Nir Eyal’s Becoming Focused and Indistractable Quest on Mindvalley helped me reclaim my attention and eliminate distractions. Nir is a former tech insider who once taught app developers how to make their platforms addictive. Now, he’s teaching people how to break free.
His methods are simple, practical, and incredibly effective for staying on track and doing your best work.
Why Your Brain Deserves More Love
We live in a world obsessed with aesthetics. People spend hours perfecting their abs, sculpting their biceps, and toning their glutes. But let me ask you this:
When was the last time you did something to strengthen your brain?
The truth is, your brain is your most valuable asset. It’s what drives your creativity, your productivity, and your ability to connect deeply with others. But because it’s invisible, we often take it for granted.
That was my mistake. I thought I could coast by without giving my brain the attention it deserved. But once I started prioritizing it, everything in my life improved.
Your Next Steps
If you’re ready to unlock your brain’s full potential, here’s where to start:
1. Try Paul McKenna’s Everyday Bliss Hypnotherapy for seven days straight.
2. Experiment with the Mindvalley Focus Pill to fuel your brain naturally.
3. Join Nir Eyal’s Becoming Focused and Indistractable Quest to master your attention and eliminate distractions.
Your brain is the gateway to your dreams. Treat it well, and it will reward you with focus, creativity, and limitless potential.
To your transformation,
Vishen

Hi [First Name],
Let’s be honest—this time of year can feel like trying to sprint a marathon that started back in January. Thanksgiving leftovers are barely gone, and suddenly we’re juggling year-end deadlines, holiday parties, and the gift-buying pressure. It’s no wonder December often feels like a swirling vortex of burnout.
But what if I told you there’s a way to flip the script on stress?
Today, I want to share an insight that could completely rewire how you handle stress—not just during the holiday madness, but in life overall. It’s backed by science and so simple that it might just blow your mind.
And the best part? It’s already working for people like you.
The Experiment That Proved Stress Can Be Your Ally
Picture this: two groups of students, both facing high-stakes situations.
Group 1 is about to play a major sports game. They’re nervous—but in a good way. Their hearts are racing, adrenaline is surging, but they feel ready to crush it.
Group 2 is preparing for a huge exam. Same adrenaline, same rapid heartbeats—but instead of confidence, they feel dread, panic, even a mental shutdown.
Same body response, two wildly different outcomes.
This got psychologist Jeremy Jamieson wondering: What if it’s not the stress itself, but how we interpret it that makes the difference?
So, Jamieson ran an experiment. He handed a simple note to half the students taking the GRE (the academic version of climbing Mount Everest):
“People think that feeling anxious while taking a standardized test will make them do poorly on the test. However, recent research suggests that arousal doesn’t hurt performance on these tests and can even help performance—people who feel anxious during a test might actually do better. This means that you shouldn’t feel concerned if you do feel anxious while taking today’s GRE test. If you find yourself feeling anxious, simply remind yourself that your arousal could be helping you do well.”
The results were jaw-dropping.
The students who didn’t get the note scored 706. But those who read the tiny note? They scored 770. That’s a 9% boost—just by reframing how they thought about stress.
Why This Matters for You
This study reveals something extraordinary: stress isn’t the villain it’s made out to be. It’s how we perceive stress that determines whether it drags us down or lifts us up.
Stress boils down to two factors:
1. Biochemistry—the physical sensations (racing heart, sweaty palms, adrenaline).
2. Belief—the story you tell yourself about what those sensations mean.
When you see stress as harmful, it drains you. But when you view it as a sign of your body gearing up for greatness, it becomes your secret weapon.
Rewiring Your Relationship with Stress
Let’s dive into the tools that can help you turn stress into your ally:
1. Reframe Stress in Real Time
Here are two powerful Mindvalley programs to get you started. Both are part of your Mindvalley membership. 
The 5 Elements of Happiness by Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar
Tal is one of the most sought-after professors on positive psychology and used to be one of Harvard’s leading professors. In this Quest, he dives deep into how we can cultivate happiness—even in the face of challenges. If burnout is your main concern, skip to Chapter 5. This section focuses on recovery techniques that will help you bounce back from stress, reset your energy, and find joy again.
Calm Mind by Dr. Caroline Leaf
If your stress feels like it’s spiraling into anxiety or affecting your mental health, Dr. Leaf’s program is essential. She specializes in neuroplasticity—how you can literally rewire your brain to handle stress differently.

2. Tap Into Your Subconscious
Stress patterns often hide in your subconscious. That’s why tools like hypnotherapy can make a huge difference:
Hypnotic Trance for Bliss by Paul McKenna
I’ve mentioned this audio before, but it’s worth repeating. Paul’s hypnotherapy session uses cutting-edge sound technology to rewire your subconscious mind. It’s like a master reset for your stress response.
I’ve personally seen how just seven days of listening can dramatically shift how you experience stress. You’ll start feeling calmer, more balanced, and better equipped to handle whatever life throws your way.
Listen to this on the Mindvalley app and make sure you listen with headphones as it uses unique sound patterns to rewire your brain in 23 mins. 
3. Support Your Body
Stress isn’t just mental—it’s physical. To truly thrive, you need to support your body too. Here’s a list of the most important supplements to help you. I crafted this list with the help of Shawn Wells, one of the leading supplement scientists in the world today and the author of The Ultimate Guide to Supplements on Mindvalley. 

Here’s Shawn’s advice on the Top Ten Supplements for Releasing Stress, Avoiding Burnout and deepening relaxation. The rating is based on their effectiveness on a score of 1 to 10 compared to other similarly studied supplements. 

Adaptogens
1. Ashwagandha (9/10)
2. Advantage: Lowers cortisol, enhances energy, and boosts resilience to stress. Highly effective for overall stress management.
3. Rhodiola Rosea (8/10)
4. Advantage: Reduces mental fatigue and enhances physical and emotional resilience. Ideal for those dealing with exhaustion.
5. Holy Basil (8/10)
6. Advantage: Balances mood, reduces anxiety, and supports emotional well-being while strengthening immunity.
Nervous System Support
1. Magnesium (10/10)
2. Advantage: A go-to for calming the nervous system, reducing muscle tension, and improving sleep. Glycinate is best for relaxation; L-Threonate for brain health.
3. L-Theanine (9/10)
4. Advantage: Provides calm focus by increasing alpha brain waves. Perfect for daytime stress relief without causing drowsiness.
5. GABA (8/10)
6. Advantage: Reduces acute anxiety and promotes calmness. Ideal for quick relaxation during overwhelming moments.
Mood Regulation
1. Vitamin B Complex (8/10)
2. Advantage: Boosts energy, supports neurotransmitter function, and combats stress-related fatigue and burnout.
3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids (9/10)
4. Advantage: Reduces inflammation and supports emotional stability. Excellent for chronic stress and mood management.
5. 5-HTP (8/10)
6. Advantage: Helps produce serotonin, regulating mood and improving sleep. Great for emotional stability and stress-related insomnia.
Other Beneficial Supplements
1. CBD Oil (9/10)
2. Advantage: Reduces anxiety quickly and promotes relaxation without psychoactive effects. Effective for both acute and chronic stress.
You can buy any of the above on your local online or real world pharmacy. Just know that CBD is yet to be legal in some countries. 

Finally Shawn and I developed our own brand of supplement to help with stress. It’s called ZEN and is an intelligent stack of multiple ingredients that combine to create a deep restful state. 

PIC OF ZEN

That’s where Zen by Mindvalley comes in, crafted with top-notch ingredients like:
- L-Theanine for calm focus.
- Apigenin to promote deep, restful sleep.
- Rhodiola Rosea to balance stress hormones.
- Magnolia Bark to soothe anxiety.
I take Zen almost daily, especially after lunch. It’s become my secret weapon for navigating busy days without feeling frazzled.

Get it from MindvalleyStates.com.
Turn Stress Into Your Superpower
This holiday season, I challenge you: when stress comes knocking, don’t resist it. Embrace it. Channel it. Let it propel you toward your goals.
You’ve got this—and I’m here cheering you on.
With love and gratitude,
Vishen

“Matthew McConaughey’s advice for creating your best 2025""
Preheader: ""Forget Resolutions—This is the Real Key to Your Best Year""
The Newsletter

Hey Name,
This is more than just a newsletter. I'm going to share the exact approach that transforms lives—including Matt's, and my own—and give you a personal AI tool I created to guide you in crafting and refining your 2025 goals. (Stick with me, keep reading, and I promise this will be worth it.)

We’re about to enter 2025. And if there’s one thing I’ve learned after years of experimenting with goal-setting, it’s this: the year ahead doesn’t happen to you—it happens through you.
That’s why it’s so important to go into this year intentionally. I don’t mean scribbling down New Year’s resolutions that vanish by February. I’ve never been a fan of those.
I’m talking about stepping into 2025 with clear desires, intentions, and a vision for who you want to become.
This isn’t just about what you’ll do, achieve, or acquire. It’s about setting an energetic tone for the entire year—clarifying the habits, beliefs, and sense of self you’re committed to.
Let me share something wild to inspire you. It’s a story from a conversation I had with Matthew McConaughey when he came on the Mindvalley Podcast.
The Dorm Room Dream That Changed Everything


Picture this: It’s 1992. Matthew McConaughey isn’t the Oscar-winning star we know today. He’s a college kid, sleeping on the top bunk of a dorm bed, probably trying to figure out life like the rest of us at that age.

But one night, he does something that changes his life forever.
He grabs a piece of paper and writes down 10 goals he wants to accomplish.
That’s it. No special system, no apps, no SMART goals. Just a list of things he deeply wanted in his soul. Most of the goals are simple.

Become a father.
Take more risks. 
Just keep livin.
But one goal stands out.

“Win an Academy Award for Best Actor.”
Now, if you look at that list (yes, he shared it in his book Greenlights), it’s… unconventional. 
It doesn’t follow the rules of goal-setting you might’ve heard before.
- It’s not “realistic.” After all, only one person gets an Academy Award for best actor every year.
- It’s not measurable. 
- It’s not time-bound. No deadline.

By every traditional standard, that list would’ve been written off as wishful thinking.
But 20 years later, Matthew was on stage at the Academy Awards, holding that golden statue.
What the heck happened?
How did something so bold, so “unrealistic,” become reality?
And here’s the kicker: Not only did Matthew win that Oscar, but every single goal on that list eventually came true.

PS - you can watch the 5 minute snippet from my interview with Matthew McConaughey where he talks about these ideas here on my @vishen instagram:

https://www.instagram.com/p/DALO37Lou84/
Manifesting Is Real—Here’s Why It Works
What Matthew did here wasn’t just a fluke or luck.
When he shared his story, I realized he had tapped into something deeper—something I believe in with every fiber of my being: Manifestation is real.
Your reality is created by the dominant thoughts in your mind.
It’s not a coincidence that Cambridge Dictionary chose “manifest” as the word of the year for 2024. More and more people are realizing that when you focus powerfully on a vision—especially one that’s tied to an emotional, heartfelt desire—you shift the odds of it becoming real.
Matthew summed it up perfectly with a phrase I’ll never forget:


“The target attracts the arrow.”

Take a moment to reflect on that.
Your vision—the “target”—isn’t passive. It pulls the arrow of your life toward it. It guides you. It whispers in your ear, nudges you toward the right people, the right ideas, the right opportunities.
The target attracts the arrow.
What Larry Page and Google Taught Me About Bold Goals

But there’s another layer to what Matthew did—and it has to do with the nature of the goals he set.
Let me take you back to my time at the University of Michigan. Larry Page, the co-founder of Google, and I both attended a leadership program called LeaderShape while we were there. And this program stressed one thing to all the undergrads who attended - leadership is about big goals and unrealistic visions. 
Years later, Larry spoke about something called the 50-50 Rule.
It’s simple:

50% of your goals should have a 50% chance of failure.

Why? Because when you stretch yourself to aim for audacious, “impossible” goals, even if you don’t hit them, you end up achieving more than you would have with smaller, safer goals.
This wasn’t just a theory for Larry—it became a core practice at Google.
How the 50-50 Rule Transformed Google
Take Google’s early days with YouTube as an example.
When Google acquired YouTube, it wasn’t yet the global video giant we know today. Larry Page set an audacious goal:
“Let’s hit 1 billion views in a single day.”
At the time, this seemed absurd. YouTube was still a niche platform, and 1 billion daily views was a staggering number.
They didn’t hit the goal right away. But aiming for it forced their teams to think bigger. They had to innovate at a pace that no one else in the industry could match.
And guess what? Today, YouTube gets over 5 billion HOURS of video per day.
Another example? Google’s moonshot projects, like self-driving cars or internet balloons to bring connectivity to rural areas.
These aren’t “safe” goals. They’re bold, they’re risky, and they come with a high chance of failure.
But here’s the magic: When failure is acceptable, thinking small isn’t.
This philosophy didn’t just push Google to achieve extraordinary things—it also created a culture where employees were free to dream big without fear.
If you’re hitting every single goal you set, you’re not thinking big enough.
This same principle can be applied to your PERSONAL goals. 

Now, look at Matthew’s list.
He had a mix of “easier” goals and incredibly bold ones. Winning an Academy Award? That’s a 50-50 goal if I’ve ever seen one.
Here’s the thing: Even if Matthew hadn’t won that Oscar, his life wouldn’t have been a failure. Because the process of striving for that level of excellence elevated every other area of his life.
What Are Your 50-50 Goals for 2025?
This brings me to you.
As you think about your goals for 2025, I want you to challenge yourself.
- Add a couple of goals that feel slightly impossible.
- Be okay with failure. It’s not the opposite of success—it’s often the path to it.
And here’s the final piece:
Alongside your bold, 50-50 goals, include what I call “self-fulfilling goals.” I describe this idea in my book “The Code of the Extraordinary Mind.”
These are simple, meaningful goals that you can achieve no matter what.
For example:
- I will truly love myself.
- I will learn and grow every day.
- I will experience the beauty of the world daily.
Think about it: Even if you lost everything tomorrow, you could still accomplish these goals. Imagine someone homeless in New York. Even in those dire circumstances this person could walk through a park and admire the trees. They could pick up a book from the New York public library for free and learn something new. If truly in touch with themselves they could experience self-love through compassion practices. 

These goals are designed to be easy. 
These goals remind you that you’re winning, even when life feels hard. And this is a good feeling to have to fuel you to pursue bigger goals. For Matthew these were things like “Chase my best self” and “Look back and enjoy the view”.
Your 2025 Blueprint

Here’s how to start:
1. Write Down 10 Goals.
    - Make 2-3 of them bold (50% chance of failure).
    - Add a few self-fulfilling goals that keep you grounded.
    - Include the usual goals that feel achievable but still meaningful.
1. Write This Phrase at the Bottom of Your List:
    - “The target attracts the arrow.”
1. Place Your List Somewhere You’ll See It Daily.
Let 2025 be the year you dream big, fail boldly, and win anyway.

Now a surprise. To help you really craft your 2025 Goals I’ve created a simple AI tool for you to use powered by OpenAI. Simple type in your goals in this AI and it will analyze your 2025 goals and help you improve and refine them.

If you want a glimpse of how this work paste this set of random goals as input and you can see the AI magic at work:

1. Find my soulmate
2. Read a book a week
3. Get to 13% bodyfat
4. Bond better with my brother
5. Go on two family vacations
6. Save 10% of my income and place it in index funds
7. Write the first 50 pages of my new book
8. 7 Day road trip across Indonesia.

The Final Word
Matthew McConaughey’s story isn’t just inspiring—it’s proof that when you align your vision with your actions, the universe moves with you.
So, grab a piece of paper. Give yourself the space to dream.
And remember, the target attracts the arrow.
Here’s to an extraordinary 2025.
With love and belief in your greatness,
Vishen

The Most Important Resolution for 2025

Image option 2:

Hey there,
As we stand at the brink of 2025, let me ask you a question:
What’s the one thing you could commit to every single week in 2025 that would create the biggest impact on your life?
Think about it. What single act, if done consistently, could make the difference between merely surviving another year and absolutely thriving?
This question came up in a podcast interview I recently did, and I knew I had to share my answer with you because it could genuinely transform your life.
Here’s the thing: This isn’t a resolution. It’s not about hitting the gym five times a week or meditating for 30 minutes every morning. Those are great habits, but this is something bigger.
It’s not a goal either. Goals are outcomes. This is a practice—one that takes less than 19 seconds to start (yes, I timed it) but could make 2025 your most transformational year yet.
What is it?
Non-Negotiable Learning Time
It sounds simple, almost too simple. But stick with me because this idea is deceptively powerful.
Here’s how it works:
In any job or career—or even life in general—there’s a danger of stagnation if all you ever do is “the work.” You get caught up in your daily tasks, putting out fires, and meeting deadlines. But when you carve out even a small amount of sacred, untouchable time to grow yourself, the results are exponential.
And I mean that literally.
Let me explain.
If you commit to improving by just 1% every single day, do you know how much better you’d be at the end of a year? Most people guess they’d double their abilities. But that’s not even close.
Here’s the math (and yes, I love math for stuff like this):
If you improve by 1% daily, by the end of the year, you’ll be 37.78 times better. That’s a 3,778% improvement!
This is the power of compounding—not in your finances, but in your skills, knowledge, and capabilities.
What Is Non-Negotiable Learning Time?
This idea comes from management theory. It’s the principle that if all you do is work, you’ll eventually stagnate. But if you carve out sacred, untouchable time to grow, you’ll unlock exponential growth—not just in your career but in every area of your life.
Here’s how it works:
If you work 40 hours a week, take two of those hours and dedicate them solely to learning. And I mean true learning—not multitasking with a podcast while driving, but intentional, focused learning.
If you’re a business owner, those two hours could be spent diving into books on leadership, studying the latest AI innovations, or taking a class on scaling a company.
If you’re a parent, maybe you spend that time learning about emotional intelligence, mindful parenting, or financial literacy to set your family up for success.
The key is this: It’s non-negotiable. No matter how busy life gets, work or errands can never creep into this sacred time.
Why This Simple Practice Works
Here’s where it gets exciting.
Most people think of growth as linear—like climbing a staircase, one step at a time. But real growth is exponential. It’s like compound interest in a bank account, except the currency is your skills, knowledge, and capabilities.
Let me break it down with some math:
If you improved by just 1% every day for 365 days, how much better would you be at the end of the year? Most people guess they’d double their abilities. But here’s the truth:
Because of the compounding effect, you’d be 37.78 times better. That’s a 3,778% improvement. Imagine walking into 2026 as a version of yourself that’s 37 times more skilled, confident, and capable.
That’s the power of non-negotiable learning time.
How to Start Non-Negotiable Learning Time
1. Block It Off
2. Take two hours a week. Put it on your calendar. Treat it like an unmissable meeting.

1. Focus on Real Learning
2. This isn’t about passive entertainment like podcasts or YouTube videos. True learning happens when you actively engage—reading a book, taking a course, or watching a Mindvalley Quest while taking notes.

1. Apply What You Learn
2. Learning is useless if you don’t act on it. Use this time to reflect on how you can apply these lessons to your life immediately.
For me, this means attending Mindvalley Mastery classes every Tuesday and Thursday. But I’ll admit, I’ve slipped up—letting work take over and skipping these sessions. That changes in 2025. My resolution is simple: Protect my learning time at all costs.

Where Should You Focus in 2025?
If you’re wondering what to focus on during your learning time, here’s where I believe the biggest opportunities lie:
1. AI Mastery
Mark my words: 2025 will be the last “normal” year in history. By 2026, AI will disrupt 50% of white-collar work. The businesses and individuals who adapt to AI will thrive. Those who don’t? They’ll struggle to keep up.
AI is already reshaping industries, from marketing to medicine. For example, I’m currently experimenting with OpenAI’s Sora to create stunning video loops for my keynote slides. The results are mind-blowing.
Start exploring tools like this now. The earlier you adopt, the bigger your advantage will be.
2. Longevity Protocols
Imagine having all the money, success, and freedom you’ve ever wanted—but no health to enjoy it. Health is wealth, and longevity is the ultimate currency.
We’re entering a new era of health science. Experts like Peter Diamandis believe we’re approaching “longevity escape velocity,” where advancements in medicine could extend human life indefinitely.
Dive into resources from Mindvalley experts like Dave Asprey, Ben Greenfield, and Ronan Diego. Learn how to slow aging, enhance vitality, and maybe even unlock decades more to live out your dreams.
3. Manifesting Mastery
Manifesting is no longer a fringe idea—it’s a proven strategy for success. In fact, Cambridge Dictionary just named “manifesting” the Word of the Year.
At its core, manifesting is about turning bold visions into reality. It’s the mindset, energy, and focus that help you move toward your dreams with resilience and purpose.
At Mindvalley, we teach practical techniques to master this skill. Whether you’re setting career goals, building a business, or creating your dream lifestyle, manifesting can accelerate your journey.
Your Role in 2025
Here’s the truth: The world is changing faster than ever. You can either be a spectator, watching it all unfold, or you can step into the driver’s seat and shape your own future.
Non-negotiable learning time is your key to staying ahead. It’s how you grow, evolve, and become 37 times better by this time next year.
So, here’s my challenge to you: Take 19 seconds right now to block out your first two hours of learning time for January. Make it sacred. Make it yours.
And if you’re ready to supercharge your growth, join me at Future Human, Mindvalley’s biggest event ever, happening in Dubai from January 9–12. We’ll dive deep into AI, longevity, and manifesting with the world’s top minds.

Oh, and if you’re tuning into CNN International on New Year’s Eve, I’ll be sharing a special message about how to step into 2025 with purpose and clarity.
I’m live on CNN 10pm tonight (Dec 31st Dubai Time) just after midnight sharing my 2025 message for the world. 

See you then. 
Here’s to exponential growth, bold visions, and making 2025 your most transformative year yet.
Warmly,
Vishen
P.S. Don’t just read this and move on. Make your learning time sacred, and let’s grow together in 2025. A great first step, open up your Google Calendar and block off two hours every week for 2025 to focus on learning. This will take you a few minutes but this simple first step will change your life.

Dear Mindvalley Family,
Here we are in 2025. I hope the year is starting off beautifully for you. But as we step into this pivotal year, there’s an idea that’s been weighing on my mind. It’s a thought so profound that it has been keeping me awake at night.
And that idea is this: 2025 will be the last “normal” year in human history.
Now, I know that sounds dramatic, even audacious. But once you see where the world is headed, you’ll understand why this year is unlike any we’ve experienced before. Let me take you on a journey through time to set the stage for what’s unfolding.
A World Frozen in Time
Let’s go back to 3 BC, to one of history’s most legendary figures—Alexander the Great. If you’re a fan of history like I am, you’ll know Alexander was a conqueror who reshaped the world as he knew it. At just 20 years old, he led an army that expanded across three continents, spreading Greek culture and uniting vast empires.
Now imagine Alexander standing in awe before the Great Pyramids of Giza. These colossal monuments, timeless and imposing, must have seemed like a glimpse of eternity to him. But here’s the astonishing part: the pyramids were already ancient when Alexander saw them—2,300 years old, to be exact.

And yet, despite the grandeur of his conquests and the cultural flourishing of his time, Alexander lived in a world that barely changed over the centuries.
Closer to the iPhone Than to the Pyramids
Now let’s add a modern twist. Alexander the Great, who stood before the pyramids, was closer in time to the invention of the iPhone than to the construction of those pyramids.
Yes, you read that right.
The same Alexander who gazed at these ancient wonders existed closer to the launch of Apple’s iPhone in 2007 than to the day those pyramids were built. Let that sink in for a moment.
And yet, for most of human history, the world barely moved forward. If Alexander had leapt 1,000 years into the future to the 12th century, he might have marveled at the majestic cathedrals of Europe or the riches of the Islamic Golden Age. But daily life? It would have been startlingly familiar. People still plowed fields by hand. They still lit their homes with oil lamps. They still relied on horses and ships to get from place to place.
Even if Alexander had jumped ahead another 500 years to the Renaissance, the printing press and gunpowder would have caught his eye. But these advancements wouldn’t have felt magical—they would have seemed like logical extensions of what he already knew.
The Century Where Magic Became Real
Now imagine Alexander fast-forwarding to the 20th century. This is where everything changes. He’d see airplanes slicing through the sky, towering skyscrapers like the Burj Khalifa (the tallest building in the world today), and those magical glass rectangles we call smartphones.
He’d watch in disbelief as humans landed on the moon. He’d witness cars driving themselves and televisions bringing moving images into every home. And then there’s the internet—a network that connects every corner of the globe, allowing instant access to the sum of human knowledge.
To Alexander, these advancements wouldn’t have seemed like progress. They’d have seemed like magic.


Peter Diamandis and the Era of Exponential Progress
What happened? How did we go from a world frozen in time to one of unimaginable transformation?
In 2016, I had the privilege of sitting down with futurist Peter Diamandis, and he explained it to me in a way I’ll never forget:
“Vishen, think of all the progress humanity made between 1900 and 2000. The airplane, the moon landing, the transistor, the internet—all of it happened in a single century. Now here’s the crazy part: the same level of technological progress we achieved in those 100 years is now being compressed into a few decades.”
Peter went on:
“Between 2000 and 2016, we saw the rise of Facebook, YouTube, Tesla, and the iPhone. But the pace of change is accelerating. From 2016 to 2022, we saw just as much innovation. And between 2022 and 2026? The same amount of progress will happen again—100 years of progress - compressed into just four years.”
I remember sitting there, stunned. Could this really be true? But now, in 2025, I see exactly what Peter meant.
The AI Explosion: Why 2025 Is Different
Over the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gone from being a futuristic concept to something that’s transforming every corner of our lives. And here’s what’s truly mind-blowing: we’re just getting started.
It’s not every day that we get a glimpse into the minds of the people shaping our future. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and one of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence, recently shared a revelation that stopped me in my tracks. His words confirmed what many of us have suspected but struggled to fully comprehend: we are on the brink of something truly extraordinary.
Sam revealed that his team is now confident in their ability to create Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This is the moment we’ve all been anticipating—the point where AI isn’t just a tool but something that thinks, reasons, and adapts like a human. And that’s not all. They’re now setting their sights even higher.
Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) just said this:

“We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents ‘join the workforce’ and materially change the output of companies. We are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word. Superintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity.”
Let that sink in for a moment. AGI—once a far-off dream—is now within reach. And even more astonishingly, we’re already thinking beyond AGI to superintelligence, a level of AI that could solve problems so complex they’re currently beyond human comprehension.
Imagine a world where diseases like cancer are eradicated, where scientific breakthroughs happen at a speed we can hardly fathom, and where abundance becomes the norm for humanity. This isn’t science fiction—it’s the future we’re stepping into. And 2025 is the year it begins.
What Is AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)?
AGI refers to AI that can think, reason, and learn at a human level across any task. Unlike today’s AI, which is task-specific, AGI would adapt like a human—writing novels, solving problems, or understanding emotions with the same versatility as a person.
What Is Superintelligence?
Superintelligence goes beyond AGI, surpassing human intelligence in every way. It could solve problems no human could comprehend, innovate at unimaginable speeds, and optimize systems like healthcare and energy to create abundance for all.
The Key Difference:
- AGI matches human intelligence.
- Superintelligence exceeds it, unlocking unimaginable possibilities.
Both have the potential to redefine our world.
And we are moving towards this faster than you think…
By the end of 2025, we’ll see the rise of AI agents. These aren’t just chatbots that help you answer emails. These are autonomous systems capable of solving complex problems, managing entire projects, and functioning as if they were human employees.
But the revolution doesn’t stop there. The next frontier is embodied AI—physical robots equipped with advanced AI. Imagine humanoid machines performing surgeries, constructing buildings, or even helping care for the elderly.
Your average street in 2028 will likely look like the picture below. With robots mingling with humans. 


The Opportunities—and the Risks
This is the double-edged sword of progress.
On one hand, AI has the potential to create a world we can hardly imagine:
- A world where cancer is cured, and diseases like Alzheimer’s become history.
- A planet where climate change is reversed, and clean energy powers every home.
- A future where poverty is eradicated, and abundance becomes the norm.
But with great power comes great responsibility.
What happens if AI becomes too powerful? Could it develop goals that conflict with ours? These aren’t just science fiction scenarios—they’re challenges we must address today.
How to Thrive in 2025
Let’s get real for a moment. This is not a normal year. The world is moving faster than ever, and the changes coming our way will disrupt nearly every aspect of life—from the way we work to the way we age, and even the way we think about reality itself.
If you’re wondering how to navigate these seismic shifts, you’re not alone. I’ve been asking myself the same question, and I’ve identified three key areas where I’m focusing my energy this year. These aren’t just strategies—they’re imperatives.
Here’s what I’m doing, and what I believe can help you thrive in this extraordinary time:
1. Master AI Before It Masters You
Let’s start with the obvious: AI is taking over.
I’ve already seen this happening in my own organization. Employees who embrace AI are doubling their productivity. They’re automating mundane tasks, generating creative ideas faster, and achieving results that used to take days in mere hours.
These individuals—what I call “AI-enabled super-producers”—are becoming the MVPs of the workplace. And here’s the kicker: it’s not because they’re smarter or more talented. It’s because they’ve decided to partner with AI rather than fear it.
If you’re an employee, ask yourself this:
- Are you using AI tools like ChatGPT, MidJourney, or other platforms to amplify your output? 
- Are you staying curious, experimenting with new ways to integrate AI into your work?
- Are you positioning yourself as someone who can leverage technology to solve problems faster?
If the answer is no, now is the time to start.
For CEOs and Leaders:
If you’re leading a company, you need to rethink everything you thought you knew about hiring and team management. Why? Because AI agents are coming—and they’re about to change the rules of the game.
These aren’t just digital assistants that write emails or schedule meetings. AI agents will be capable of managing entire projects, solving complex problems, and even operating with the decision-making skills of a mid-level manager.
Imagine this:
- Instead of hiring 10 new employees, you deploy 5 AI agents that can handle 70% of the workload.
- Instead of spending months training a new hire, you onboard an AI agent in hours.
- Instead of relying on outdated processes, your organization evolves in real-time, driven by AI insights.
This is the future, and it’s happening faster than you think.
How I’m Applying This:
At Mindvalley, I’ve stopped hiring in the traditional sense. Instead, we’re focusing on upskilling our existing team to become AI-enabled super-producers. My belief is that the best teams of the future won’t just be composed of humans—they’ll be humans and AI working in perfect synergy.
If you want to thrive in 2025, start thinking about how you can integrate AI into every corner of your work. Whether you’re an individual contributor, a manager, or a business owner, AI isn’t just a tool—it’s your new partner in success.
2. Invest in Longevity
Let’s talk about your health.
With the rise of AI and breakthroughs in biotech, we’re entering an era where living to 100—or even 120—will be entirely possible. But here’s the question: do you want to live those extra decades thriving or just surviving?
For me, the answer is clear. I want to thrive. I want to wake up at 100 feeling energized, flexible, and mentally sharp. And if you’re alive today, you have a chance to achieve this too—but only if you start investing in your health now.
The Future of Longevity:
AI and superintelligence are already accelerating breakthroughs in medicine. Imagine a world where diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s are eradicated. Where stem cell treatments repair damaged organs. Where personalized medicine optimizes your body’s performance in ways we can’t yet fathom.
That future is closer than you think. And if you’re not paying attention to longevity science, you’re missing out on one of the greatest revolutions of our time.
What I’m Doing:
This year, I’m diving headfirst into advanced longevity protocols. Here are a few examples:
- Stem Cell Therapy: I’ll be working with Dr. Adil Khan in Dubai to repair a recurring back issue and enhance overall vitality.
- Muscle Optimization Protocols: I’m exploring treatments that amplify muscle growth, so every gym session delivers maximum results.
- Reversing Signs of Aging: Yes, I’m even experimenting with therapies that reduce gray hair and improve skin health. Why? Because feeling good about your appearance is part of thriving.
Now, I know some of these treatments might sound out of reach for most people. But you don’t need to start with cutting-edge science to invest in your health. The basics—regular exercise, clean eating, quality sleep—are the foundation of longevity.
Where to Start:
If you’re curious about how to begin your own longevity journey, I highly recommend Dave Asprey’s Smarter Not Harder Quest on Mindvalley. Dave, known as the father of biohacking, breaks down simple, practical strategies you can use to optimize your health today.
3. Master the Art of Manifesting
In a world of rapid change, the ability to manifest your goals and shape your reality isn’t just a nice-to-have—it’s essential.
Now, before you roll your eyes, let me explain. Manifesting isn’t about wishful thinking or repeating affirmations in the mirror. It’s about taking control of your mind and using it as a tool to create the life you want.
What Manifesting Really Means:
- Clarity: Get crystal-clear on what you want to achieve in 2025. What’s your vision for your career, your health, your relationships? Write it down. Make it vivid.
- Resilience: The world is unpredictable. Manifesting requires building mental toughness, so you can stay focused even when life throws curveballs.
- Actionable Steps: Manifesting isn’t magic—it’s a system. Break your goals into tangible, actionable steps, and commit to them daily.
How It Works:
At Mindvalley, we’ve been teaching manifestation techniques for years, and I can tell you this: the results are real. From creating abundance to transforming relationships, the power of your mind is limitless—if you know how to harness it.
To dive deeper, join us at our Manifesting Mastery Event this month. Alongside incredible teachers like Reagan Hillier and Jeffrey Allen, I’ll be sharing tools to help you navigate this era of disruption with clarity and purpose.
Why These 3 Areas Matter
Here’s the bottom line: 2025 is a year of transformation. The rules are changing, and the opportunities are endless. But if you’re not prepared—if you don’t adapt—you risk being left behind.
By mastering AI, investing in your health, and sharpening your ability to manifest, you’re not just surviving this era of change—you’re thriving in it.

This weekend, we’re hosting the Future of Humans Festival in Dubai—a gathering of some of the brightest minds and most inspiring thought leaders on the planet. If you’ve been following the conversation around AI, longevity, and human potential, this event is where it all comes together.
Here’s what makes this festival extraordinary:
- Game-Changing Ideas: We’ll explore the themes shaping the future—AI, longevity science, human consciousness, and more. These are ideas that will help you stay ahead of the curve in 2025 and beyond.
- World-Class Speakers: The lineup includes icons like Steven Bartlett (Diary of a CEO), Jay Shetty, Grammy-winning artist Eve, and Mindvalley legends like Reagan Hillier, Lisa Nichols, Marisa Peer and Dave Asprey.
- Incredible Community: Whether in person or online, you’ll connect with a global tribe of visionaries, thinkers, and doers who are as committed to growth as you are.
Can’t Make It to Dubai?
No problem. You can join us virtually for just $29. This isn’t just a live stream—it’s a fully immersive experience. With Mindvalley’s new Zoom feature, you can watch the event in simulated real-time, tailored to your time zone. So even if you’re on the other side of the world, you won’t miss a thing.
Why just $29? Because we believe the knowledge being shared at this festival is too important to keep exclusive. We want to make it accessible to as many people as possible.

Join Online from Your Home on Zoom for just $29

Let’s make 2025 the year you step into your full potential. I can’t wait to see you at the festival—either live in Dubai or virtually from wherever you are.

Opening: A Personal Note from Vishen 
Dear (name),
This year, something extraordinary happened. 
Over 8,000 people gathered—3,000 of us live in Dubai, and 5,000 more joining virtually—for Future Human. It was the largest event in Mindvalley’s history, and for three unforgettable days, we explored the intersection of technology, consciousness, and human potential.
We weren’t just imagining the future; we were building it.
But here’s the thing: the insights we uncovered weren’t meant to stay confined to the walls of that event. They’re meant for you, wherever you are in the world.
Today, I want to share 6 of the most powerful lessons from Future Human—lessons that have the potential to unlock something extraordinary in your life. These aren’t just ideas; they’re action steps, infused with wisdom and designed to elevate your journey.
So grab a cup of tea, sit back, and let’s dive into the future—together.
6 Transformative Insights from Future Human
1. Will AI Develop a Soul? – Jay Shetty

Jay Shetty posed a question that left everyone in the room in deep thought: Can AI ever have a soul?
We’re living in a time when AI is creating art, composing music, and even holding conversations. But Jay reminded us that AI, no matter how advanced, will never replicate what makes us human: our ability to love, empathize, and connect.
This isn’t just about AI—it’s about us. The future demands that we nurture our humanity. It’s not about fearing machines; it’s about amplifying our unique gifts. How will you bring more soul into the world?
2. The Power of Intuition – Vishen Lakhiani

Let me tell you something deeply personal: every pivotal moment in my life was guided by intuition.
At Future Human, I shared how intuition isn’t just a mysterious force—it’s a skill we can cultivate. In a world overwhelmed with information, intuition becomes your inner compass, guiding you toward clarity and alignment.
Imagine navigating life not with doubt but with certainty, knowing your next step is exactly where you’re meant to be. That’s what intuition offers. Are you ready to trust yours?
3. Evicting Your Limiting Beliefs – Lisa Nichols

Lisa Nichols didn’t just speak—she transformed the room.
She asked us a powerful question: What story are you living by, and is it even yours?
So many of us live by narratives we didn’t write—beliefs handed down from family, culture, or society. Lisa shared how she rewrote her own story, showing us that we can all release what no longer serves us and step into our power.
What’s one belief you’re ready to evict? And what’s the new story you’ll write in its place?
5. How to Become the Best in the World – Steven Bartlett

Steven Bartlett revealed the science behind peak performance. His message? Excellence isn’t talent—it’s training.
Through flow states and deliberate practice, Steven showed how anyone can achieve mastery in any field. But the key isn’t a one-time effort—it’s daily consistency.
What’s one small habit you can start today to take a step closer to greatness?
4. Manifest Infinite Potential – Regan Hillyer

Regan Hillyer guided us into the art and science of manifestation with one profound insight: Your reality mirrors the energy you hold.
Manifestation isn’t just about thinking positive—it’s about alignment. Regan showed us how to raise our frequency, align with our desires, and bring them into reality.
For those ready to go deeper, don’t miss our upcoming event, Masters of Manifesting, where we’ll explore the principles and practices of infinite potential.
6. Filling the Void Within – Marisa Peer

Marisa Peer addressed something deeply universal: the emptiness we often feel, even when life seems “fine.”
Her solution? Stop waiting for others to fill that void. Instead, meet your own emotional needs. Marisa shared a simple but transformative practice: every day, look in the mirror and say, “I am enough.”
It’s a small act that can create profound change. Are you ready to fill your cup?
Your Next Steps: Mindvalley Events and More
Transformation isn’t a one-time experience—it’s a journey. That’s why we’re creating opportunities for you to continue exploring, connecting, and growing.
Here’s how you can take your next step:

Closing: From My Heart to Yours
Here’s the thing: the future isn’t something we wait for. It’s something we create—through our actions, our thoughts, and the energy we bring to the world.
The six insights I’ve shared today are more than just lessons—they’re invitations. Invitations to listen to your intuition, rewrite your story, and align with your infinite potential.
But remember, transformation doesn’t happen in isolation. It happens in community. So follow us on Instagram, join an upcoming event, and connect with a tribe that’s on the same journey.
Your best future is waiting. Let’s create it together.
To your extraordinary potential,
Vishen

Newsletter: The 30-Minute Longevity Hack That Transformed My Dad’s Life

Hey there,
Let me ask you something: When you imagine yourself at 70 or 80, what do you see? Are you climbing stairs with ease? Dancing at your grandkids’ wedding? Or are you struggling to even get up from the couch?
Here’s the thing about longevity: It’s not just about living longer—it’s about living better. That means adding more years to your life and more life to your years. And that’s what Day 2 of Future Human was all about: cracking the code on longevity, vitality, and thriving well into your 80s, 90s, and beyond.
(By the way, if you missed it, I just posted some of my favorite photos from Day 2 on Instagram. Go check them out! See if you can guess which of the three elderly ladies in the first photo is my mom. Hint: She’s rocking the kind of energy that’ll make you wonder if she found the fountain of youth.)


Now, back to longevity. On Day 2, we heard from some of the world’s top minds, including Dave Asprey, Ronan Diego, Lisa Nichols, and others. They talked about everything from biohacking and breathwork to the power of community. But one thing stood out to me—something so simple yet profound—it might just be the ultimate hack for staying young.

It’s your muscles.
Muscles: Your Secret Weapon for Longevity
Let me explain. There’s this fascinating concept I learned at Future Human. One of the strongest predictors of longevity is muscle strength. Why? Because your muscles are directly tied to so many vital functions: mobility, energy levels, and even your ability to maintain a sense of independence and connection as you age.
But here’s the kicker. You don’t need to spend hours in the gym. You don’t need to aim for the “gym bro” look or worry about getting a six-pack. This isn’t about vanity—it’s about functional strength.
In fact, you can dramatically improve your muscle health—and your lifespan—with just 30 minutes a week.
My Dad’s Journey: From Struggling to Thriving

Let me share a story to show you how powerful this is.
When my dad turned 70, he got some devastating news from his doctor. He was in such poor shape that the doctor estimated he might only have five years left to live.
Hearing this broke my heart. So, I decided to do something about it. I introduced my dad to Lorenzo Delano, one of the brilliant minds behind Mindvalley’s 10X Fitness program.
Now, Lorenzo didn’t throw my dad into some crazy boot camp. Instead, he guided him through a simple, science-backed protocol: 30 minutes in the gym, once a week. That’s it.
When my dad started, he could leg press 80 kilograms (~176 lbs). After just four weeks, his strength increased to 150 kilograms (~330 lbs). That’s an 80% increase in strength—with less than 2 hours of total gym time.
The transformation was incredible. Suddenly, my dad could hike, climb stairs, and do things he hadn’t been able to do in years. A few years later, he and I even went hiking in the desert of Jordan at Petra—a feat that would’ve been impossible before.
What’s happening here? It’s all about reversing sarcopenia—the natural muscle loss that starts in your 30s and accelerates as you age. The best part? According to Lorenzo, reversing this muscle loss takes just 2 hours of exercise per year.
Yes, you read that right. Two hours a year can keep your muscles from wasting away and help you maintain the strength you had at 30 well into your 70s.

The Science Behind 10X: Minimum Effective Dose
So how does this work? The magic of 10X lies in something called the minimum effective dose. It’s a concept inspired by Doug McGuff, MD, author of the groundbreaking book Body by Science.
Here’s the gist: Instead of spending hours at the gym, you focus on five key exercises that give you the biggest bang for your buck.
Here are the exercises we recommend:
1. Leg Press
2. Lat Pulldown
3. Chest Press
4. Cable Row
5. Shoulder Press
And here’s how you do them:
- Use 65–70% of your one-rep max (the heaviest weight you can lift once).
- Do 1 set of 10–14 reps per exercise.
- Each rep takes 5 seconds: 2 seconds pushing or pulling, and 3 seconds on the return.
- Move from one machine to the next without resting.
This protocol puts your muscles under just enough strain to stimulate growth, without overworking them. And because it’s so efficient, the whole session takes only 30 minutes, including time to check into the gym and grab your stuff from your locker.
Do this once or twice a week, and you’ll not only reverse muscle loss—you’ll feel stronger, more energized, and more capable than ever.
Take this case study of a 10X user from the US Military. Mary (name changed) was already fit as she was in the army. But check out her before and after results when she started with 10X. The most impressive is that her body fat fell from 43% to 23% in 6 months and her total workout time in the gym was 40 mins PER WEEK.

Your Longevity Starts Now
If you’re intrigued by this, I highly recommend trying it out for yourself. You don’t need fancy equipment or hours of free time. All you need is a gym, 30 minutes, and a commitment to your health.
Here’s the one-page guide we provided at Future Human.

And if you’re a Mindvalley Member, you can dive deeper into the 10X Fitness Quest, where Lorenzo and his team walk you through every step of the process.

This isn’t just about adding years to your life. It’s about making those years count. Because the goal isn’t just to live longer—it’s to live better.
Here’s to your health and longevity,

The C.R.Y.S.T.A.L Formula: Manifest Your Best Life in 7 Steps


Optional Preheaders
“7 steps to clarity, alignment, and bringing your dreams to life.”


	The C.R.Y.S.T.A.L Formula: 7 Keys to Manifesting Your Best Life

I just got back from an incredible experience in Dubai: Masters of Manifesting. This event wasn’t just about the power of manifesting—it was about taking what feels intangible and giving it form, structure, and flow.
Manifesting is one of the most sought-after topics at Mindvalley, and it’s something I’ve personally explored for decades. To me, manifesting is the art of turning the dreams in your mind into reality—faster, more effectively, and with greater joy and ease.
At this event, we brought together amazing speakers like Reagan Hillyer (The Art of Manifesting), Jeffrey Allen (Duality and Unlocking Transcendence), John Lee (Seven Figure Creator), and yes, me.

As I sat there taking notes from these incredible minds, a powerful realization struck me: manifesting doesn’t have to feel mysterious or complex. There’s a simple, actionable framework anyone can follow.
I call it the CRYSTAL formula—seven key steps that make your manifesting journey crystal clear. Whether you’re manifesting a dream job, a soulmate, financial freedom, or just a better version of yourself, this formula can help you bring it to life.
Let’s dive in.
C: Clarity
“Vague desires produce vague results.”
Let’s start with the foundation. Clarity is the most important step in manifesting—and also the most overlooked.
If your vision is fuzzy, your results will be, too. You can’t just say, “I want more money” or “I want a better job.” You need to get specific. What’s the exact salary you want? What kind of company do you want to work for? What’s the daily experience you want to create for yourself?
Here’s how to get crystal clear:
1. Write it down. Goals written down are 42% more likely to be achieved.
2. Visualize it. Close your eyes and create a vivid mental picture. What does your ideal life look like?
3. Use tools. Programs like Mindvalley’s Lifebook guide you to map out your entire life vision in extraordinary detail, creating a personal blueprint for your future.
The clearer your vision, the easier it is to focus your energy. Clarity creates alignment, and alignment creates momentum.

R: Resilience
“The road to success isn’t linear—it’s a rollercoaster.”
Let’s be honest: manifesting your dreams isn’t always smooth sailing. You will face setbacks, challenges, and moments of doubt. The key is how you respond when things don’t go as planned.
Michael Beckwith, one of my mentors, talks about “Kensho moments”—growth that comes through challenges. These are the times when life throws you into the fire, testing your strength and commitment.
Resilience is about developing the grit to move forward, no matter what. But it’s also about self-compassion. Treat yourself with kindness. Love yourself through the tough moments.
Here’s how to cultivate resilience:
1. Reframe setbacks. Ask yourself, “What lesson is this trying to teach me?”
2. Anchor yourself in your vision. Remind yourself of your “why.”
3. Celebrate progress. Every small step forward is a victory worth celebrating.
Manifesting is a journey, not a straight line. Stay resilient, and you’ll turn obstacles into stepping stones.

Y: Your Inner Voice
“Listen to your heart and intuition. Somehow, they already know who you are meant to become.” – Steve Jobs
Too often, we set goals based on what others expect of us—parents, society, culture. But true manifesting starts when you connect with your inner voice.
Intuition is like a compass, pointing you toward what’s aligned with your soul. But to hear it, you need to quiet the external noise: the societal expectations, the cultural pressures, and the opinions of others.
Here’s how to strengthen your intuition:
- Meditate. Silence the chatter in your mind.
- Journal. Writing helps you uncover your inner truth.
- Ask yourself. When faced with a decision, pause and ask, “Does this feel expansive or restrictive?”
When you trust your inner voice, you align with your deepest truths—and that’s where the real magic happens.

S: Speed of Action
“Don’t wait for the perfect moment. Start now.”
Manifesting isn’t just about thinking—it’s about doing. The moment you take action, you tell the universe: “I’m serious about this.”
Napoleon Hill, in Think and Grow Rich, emphasizes the power of small, consistent steps. Every action, no matter how small, builds momentum.
Let’s say you’re starting a business. Here’s how to break it down:
1. Research domain names.
2. Register your business.
3. Sketch out your first product idea.
4. Each step creates clarity for the next. Action isn’t just about progress—it’s about signaling your intention to the universe.

T: Trust
“What you believe about the world tends to become true.” 
Trust is the cornerstone of manifesting. It’s about belief and expectancy. José Silva, the legendary founder of the Silva Method, taught that manifesting isn’t just about desire. It’s about three things:
1. Desire. Get clear on what you want.
2. Belief. Cultivate unshakable faith that it’s possible.
3. Expectancy. Act as if it’s already happening.
The law of resonance says that the universe reflects who you are, not what you want. When you believe and expect your vision to come true, you align yourself with the frequency of your desires.
Visualization is one of the most powerful tools here. José Silva emphasized the importance of imagining your goals so vividly that your brain starts treating them as real. We call this approach Creative Visualization. Programs like Be Extraordinary and Creative Visualization teach this in depth, helping you turn belief into reality.

A: Alignment
“When your energy, mind, and body align, magic happens.”
Manifesting isn’t just about action—it’s about energy. Alignment means syncing your physical, emotional, and spiritual states with your desires.
Practices like gratitude, forgiveness, and compassion aren’t just feel-good exercises—they’re scientifically proven to elevate your vibration. For example, studies show that forgiveness can improve physical performance and even increase endurance.
Here’s how to get aligned:
- Practice forgiveness to release emotional blocks.
- Use gratitude to elevate your energy.
- Meditate to center your mind and body.
Jeffrey Allen’s program Duality is perfect for this, teaching you how to align your energy with your goals. And the 6 Phase Meditation is a daily practice that shifts you into a state of flow, amplifying your ability to manifest.

L: Love Your Journey
“Gratitude turns your journey into a masterpiece.”
This step is about embracing the process. Manifesting isn’t just about achieving—it’s about experiencing joy along the way.
Tim Storey calls this “magical living.” and goes deep into it in his Quest on Mindvalley. It’s about appreciating the small, beautiful moments in life. 
Recently, I spoke with Grammy-winning artist Eve, who shared her personal gratitude practice: “I simply express gratitude for everything—the sun, the trees, the flowers. It keeps me grounded and joyful.”
When you focus on gratitude, you amplify the joy and abundance in your life, which, in turn, attracts more of it.
		
Final Thoughts
The CRYSTAL formula is more than just a checklist—it’s a lifestyle. Each step builds on the others, creating a powerful framework to manifest your dreams.
Now, let me share something truly exciting.
If you’ve been scrolling through social media recently, you’ve probably seen the jaw-dropping photos from our Mindvalley Gala at the iconic Dubai Expo. It was a night where transformation met luxury—a celebration of the world’s greatest teachers, innovators, and thought leaders.
The energy in that room was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Imagine standing under the stunning Dubai skyline, surrounded by people like Steven Kotler, Jay Shetty, Regan Hillyer, and Paul McKenna. Each story, each standing ovation, each moment of connection—it was a collective manifestation of what’s possible when we dream big and act boldly.
And we thought, why should this energy be limited to one night?

The Energy That Shook My Chair… And Transformed My Life
This email covers two things—both of which might tickle your mind. 
The first is about something called Kundalini energy. A surge of energy that many people report as a feeling of being shotshoot up their spine. 

And why does it seem to be happening to more and more people right now?
The second?
How we actually discover talent at Mindvalley.
Because here’s the thing—our biggest teachers weren’t always teachers.
In fact, people like Marisa Peer, Jeffrey Allen, Regan Hillyer, and Niraj Naik weren’t bestselling authors or famous speakers when we found them.
We found all of them sitting in the audience at a Mindvalley event.
So if you’ve ever dreamed of becoming a Mindvalley teacher, this story is going to surprise you.
And strangely enough—both stories are deeply connected.
So grab a cup of tea, settle in, and get ready—this is going to be a long email.
But I promise, by the time you’re done reading, you’ll look at manifestation, intuition, and your own potential in a completely new way.

The Experiment That Changed My Reality
Let’s rewind to 2015.
Dave Asprey, the legendary biohacker, founder of Bulletproof Coffee, and creator of 40 Years of Zen, invited me to participate in a cutting-edge experiment at his brain training facility in Seattle.
The goal?
To figure out how to give an ordinary person a monk’s brain.
Dave and his team had studied the neurological patterns of monks and found two fascinating things:
✅ High Alpha Amplitude – Monks have elevated alpha brainwavesbrainwaves, linked to deep relaxation and peak creativity.

✅ Left-Right Brain Coherence – Their brain hemispheres are in complete synchronization.
So the theory was simple:
If we could replicate these patterns using advanced biofeedback, we could literally rewire someone’s brain to function like a monk’s brain—without requiring decades of meditation.
This is what brought me to Seattle to participate in several sessions at Dave’s Mind Training Institute 40 Years of Zen. 

And there I was—sitting in a dark chamberchamber, with twelve electrodes attached to my head, staring at a screen that displayed my brain waves in real timereal-time.

For five days, I trained my brain to manipulate these visual and audio cuescues, while practicing specific exercises—forgiveness, compassion, andcompassion, appreciation.	
And then…
Something really strange happened.
💥 My chair started shaking violently.
At first, I thought one of the scientists was behind me, messing around.
Why the hell would someone shake my chair in the middle of my meditation?
I opened my eyes andeyes, turned around—but there was no one there.
And yet, I could feel something.
A surge of energy movedmoving up my spine, vibrating through my entire body. It wasn’t my chair shaking—itshaking - it was my entire upper body. 
I closed my eyes again—and suddenly, I was flung into a swirling red vortex in my mind. 
It felt like I had been pulled into another dimension.
ThenThen, I heard a powerful, firm, deeply reassuring voice.
It told me:
👉 You are safe.
👉 You are on the right path.
👉 Keep going.

In a semi-lucid state, this voice spoke to me in a firm, commanding way, telling me to stay focused on my vision for Mindvalley. Where I had doubts, it eased them. And where I needed clarity, itclarity - it told me to stick to my path. 
And then—it taught me something.
A technique.
But not just any technique—something that completely flipped my understanding of manifestation on its head.
For years, I had taught creative visualization—the idea that to manifest something, you need to picture it vividly in your mind.
But this voice told me:
You don’t need to visualize what you want.
You simply need to become the energy of what you want.
It called this technique Merging.
And it was so powerful that I later included it in Be Extraordinary, my signature Mindvalley program. (You will find the Merging technique for manifesting in the final week of the Be Extraordinary Program on Mindvalley Membership)
Now, I walked out of that session completely shaken (literally and metaphorically). 
I described the violent shaking to the scientists.
And they looked at me, slightly puzzled.
""That sounds like a Kundalini awakening,"" one of them said.
I dismissed it.
Kundalini? Some weird spiritual concept?
I figured I’d Google it someday and movemoved on with my life.
Or so I thought.

Then, Something Even Crazier Happened…
Fast forward to September 18, 2017. It’s now 4 weeks after my so-calledso called kundalini awakening. 
I was sitting in my studystudy, working on my computer, when a strong, unshakable intuition hit me.
🔹 Check your book rankings on Amazon.
I resisted.
My first book, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, had been a mild success—it peaked at #4 on the New York Times list, then dropped off the list. I had put in so much work into the book,book but after years of writing just wanted to rest, recover,recover and not think about that book again. 
Why would I want to check its rankings on Amazon?
I didn’t feel like seeing my book slowly disappeardisappearing into the abyss of forgotten titles.
But the thought kept pushing itself into my mind.
🔹 Check your book on Amazon.
🔹 Check your book on Amazon.
So I gave in.
I logged into Amazon Author Central and froze.
I assumed Amazon was broken.
Because it showed me that I was the #2 author in the entire world.
Somehow, my book had overtaken:
✅ Hillary Clinton (whose book had just launched)
✅ The combined works of J.R.R. Tolkien
✅ The entire Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling
Here’s an actual screenshot from Amazon on that day. 

So I nowknow went to check my book’s rankings. My book was the #2 book in the world. No, not in a specific category. In ALL CATEGORIES. 

And the day before?
📢 I had been #1.

Another screenshot to show this:


🚨 WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. HECK?! 🚨
The Code of the Extraordinary Mind became the #1 Book in the entire world for 5 Days in 2017. 

(You can get it from Amazon here if you’d like to check it out)


Now I’d like to gift you a Kundalini Experience

So Kundalini experiences occur to people when they are in altered states. It happens to some during meditation, sometimes during sex, and also often during plant medicine or neuro-training experiencesexperienced (like my experience at 40 Years of Zen).

But you can also experience it via a great facilitator. 



The woman in the picture above is Dawn Hoang. She has the unique ability to channel energy and ‘beam’ it across a room and cause the people in that room to sometimes experience spontaneous Kundalini awakenings. 

Here’s her story

Kundalini Awakenings, Orgasmic Moaning, and Mindvalley’s Next Big Star
Dawn’s story begins at Mindvalley University,University where thousands of Mindvalley enthusiasts come together for two weeks to experience hundreds of talks, workshops, and transformational sessions. This year it'sits happening in Amsterdam on Aug 4 to 18. 

It’s unlike any event on the planet.
And here’s something most people don’t know:
Mindvalley University isn’t just about bringing world-class speakers and trainers.
It’s also about discovering new talent.
Here’s how it works:
👉 Over two weeks, we feature 100 speakers and presenters.
👉 50 of them are our established Mindvalley trainers—among the best in the world.
👉 But the other 50 spots?
They’re open to our community members.
That means anyone—from spiritual teachers to AI researchers to biohackers—can apply for a chance to take the stage.
Getting selected isn’t easy.
Every year, 400–500 people apply for just 50 spots.
But those who make it?
They often go on to become the next big names in personal growth.
That’s exactly what happened to Dawn Hoang.

Dawn Hoang’s Journey—From Audience Member to Mindvalley Star
Dawn had been a longtime Mindvalley fan.
She was there at our very first event in 2010—as a volunteer.
She watched Mindvalley grow.
She attended our events.
And in 2023, she decided to take a leap of faith.
She applied to speak at Mindvalley University.
Her topic? Kundalini Awakening.
If you’ve never heard of Kundalini, let me explain what makes it so unique.

The Experience That Left People in Tears… and Dancing
Dawn was selected to lead two sessions on Kundalini Activation.
And what happened next was wild.
Here’s what a Dawn Hoang Kundalini Awakening session looks like:
🔹 Dawn stands in the center of a room.
🔹 She taps into an energy field.
🔹 That energy is transmitted to every participant in the room.
Sounds strange, right?
But the effects on people are undeniable.
Imagine this:
✅ Some people enter a deep state of relaxation—almost like being in a trance.
✅ Others begin shedding tears as old emotional wounds heal before their eyes.
✅ Some feel energy moving through their bodies—like a wave of electricity.
✅ And some?


Some stand up and start dancing—completely lost in the energy, moving as if something is guiding them.
Now, here’s where things get really interesting.
A handful of participants start making orgasmic moaning sounds. The kundalini energy, after all, starts at the sacral chakra. 
Tears, dancing, moaning—all happening at the same time.
And yet…
Every single person who experienced it came out transformed.
Even those who felt nothing reported a deep sense of peace, clarity, and renewal.

What Happened Next Was Mind-Blowing
After Dawn’s first Kundalini Awakening session, something wonderful happened.
The session rating came in.
Perfect 5.0.
That rarely happens.
So naturally, by the time her second session came around…
It was completely flooded.
People were jumping past security barricades just to get inside.
Dawn asked us for more speaking slots—but we were completely booked.
So she did something truly kind…
On her own dime, she rented a local yoga studio and offered free Kundalini Awakening sessions to anyone who wanted one.
By the end of Mindvalley University…
She had guided 700 people through Kundalini Activation.
For free.
Why?
Because at Mindvalley University, we follow the principles of Burning Man.
That means if you speak or facilitate, you don’t charge.
It’s a gifting economy.
And Dawn embraced that completely.
At the end of the event, we reviewed our 50 community speakers to find the breakout stars.
Dawn’s name came out on top.
So at the Mindvalley Awards Gala in Dubai, she was honored with the Community Star Award.
And to present it to her?
None other than Grammy Award-winning artist Eve—famous for Who’s That Girl?

By Vishen Lakhiani

The Paragraph That Changed My Speed of Manifesting
It’s no secret that I’m a big fan of the Conversations with God book series by Neale Donald Walsch. Across the massive set of books and the millions upon millions of words they contain, there’s one paragraph that changed my life forever—and it’s this:
I’m sharing screenshot of this particular quote here from my iPhone


This one insight explained something that had puzzled me for years:
Why do some people manifest everything effortlessly while others struggle, even when they work hard and do all the “right” things?
The answer is absolute clarity.
When you lack clarity, when you send mixed signals about what you want, when your thoughts, actions, and beliefs are out of alignment, you get mixed results.
But when you become crystal clear—when your mind, body, and soul are fully aligned behind a decision—reality bends to your will.
This is how true manifestation happens.
Let’s break this down
Everything you desire comes into reality through three levels:
1. The Body (Action & Execution)
- What are you physically doing to bring your desires to life?
- Are you taking the right actions, making the right decisions, and structuring your life around what you want?
2. The Mind (Belief & Focus)
- What do you believe about your desires?
- Do you feel worthy of them? Or do you sabotage yourself with doubt, fear, and guilt?
3. The Soul (Deeper Purpose & Alignment)
- Does your desire resonate with your deeper self?
- Are you pursuing it because it truly fulfills you, or because of external validation?
But when you gain absolute clarity on what you want—when your mind, body, and soul are in perfect alignment—reality bends in your favor. Things start showing up effortlessly. Life begins to feel like it’s guiding you toward your goals rather than resisting you at every step.
This is the foundation of Bending Reality—not wishful thinking, not hoping the universe delivers, but becoming so clear and unwavering in your desires that reality has no choice but to respond.

The Universe Listens to Clarity
One of my favorite quotes about desire and clarity comes from Paulo Coelho, author of The Alchemist:
“When you really want something, it's because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. The universe is nourished by people’s happiness. When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”
This is a profound realization.
Your desires are not random. They don’t come from ego or wishful thinking. They are signals from the universe—the universe experiencing itself through you.
The problem is, most people send conflicting messages about what they want.
One part of them desires something deeply, while another part questions it, doubts it, or fears it.
The result? Nothing happens.
But when you reach absolute clarity—when you stand firm in your choice, with no hesitation, no fear, and no second-guessing—the universe moves.
The Universe Listens to Clarity: The Esther Hicks Perspective
One of the most powerful teachings about desire and manifestation comes from Abraham Hicks, channeled through Esther Hicks.
She explains that the entire point of existence is to observe everything around us and create new desires.
Every time you see something you love—whether it’s a beautiful house, a thriving relationship, an inspiring career—you send out rockets of desire into the universe. These rockets are energy waves that start moving the pieces in reality to bring your desires into form.
But there’s a problem.
Most people shoot out these rockets of desire and then immediately cancel them with doubt, fear, or uncertainty. Instead of trusting that the universe is aligning, they change their mind, hesitate, or question whether they truly deserve it.
Clarity is what allows your desires to take form.
Without clarity, you create mixed energy signals—and mixed signals create mixed results.
Let me share a story that perfectly illustrates this.

A Dream Home Delayed by Uncertainty
I have a friend who had a crystal-clear vision of his dream home.
- He knew the structure—modern, spacious, flooded with natural light.
- He knew the style—elegant, minimal, deeply luxurious.
- He knew the feeling—a place of peace, inspiration, and creativity.
And yet, despite having the money, resources, and knowledge to get that house, it never materialized.
Why?
Because deep down, he was afraid.
At a subconscious level, he feared living in that house alone. He was single, and the thought of being in this huge dream home without a partner made him uneasy.
So, even though he thought he wanted it, his subconscious was sending a conflicting signal:
""I want this house.""
""But what if I feel lonely?""
""What if it’s too much for me?""
""What if I don’t deserve this just yet?""
And so, nothing moved.
The right house didn’t show up.
The right deals never came.
The money stayed in limbo.
But then, something changed.
He met someone. He fell in love.
And suddenly, his vision of the dream home expanded—it was no longer just a house for him, but a home for them.
And as soon as he got clear, everything moved.
- The perfect house appeared.
- The financial situation aligned.
- The opportunity came effortlessly.
This is why clarity is everything.
Your what-ifs jeopardize your manifestations. The moment you remove doubt, the universe delivers.
How to Gain Clarity: The Three Most Important Questions
If you have 20 minutes, doingdo the Three Most Important Questions exercise on Mindvalley Membership will truly help. I designed this approach to help anyone get instant clarity on their life vision in 20 mins. 
- This simple process will strip away societal conditioning and give you immediate clarity on what truly matters in your life.
- You’ll walk away knowing exactly what to focus on in 2025 to make it your most extraordinary year yet.

The Secret of All Masters
Neale Donald Walsch shares another insight that completely transformed my understanding of success:
“Remember, life is an ongoing process of creation. You are creating your reality every minute. The decision you make today is often not the choice you make tomorrow. Yet here is a secret of all Masters: keep choosing the same thing.”
This is the single biggest reason people fail at manifesting.

The Parable of the Waiter and the Soup
I shared a story at our recent Masters of Manifesting Seminar in Dubai that I’d like to repeat to you here.
Imagine this. You walk into a restaurant. You sit down, feeling hungry, excited about the meal you’re about to have.
The waiter approaches.
“Sir, what would you like today?”
You glance at the menu and say, “You know what? I’m feeling like something warm and comforting. I’ll have the soup.”
“Excellent choice,” the waiter says, nodding, and he heads off to the kitchen to inform the Chef.
Now, behind the scenes, something interesting happens. The chef immediately starts working on your order. He pulls out fresh ingredients, starts heating the broth, chopping vegetables, seasoning the dish just right. He’s getting everything ready to serve you exactly what you asked for.
But then, suddenly, you change your mind.
“Waiter! Waiter!” You call him back. He rushes over.
“Yes, sir?”
“You know what? Soup is nice, but I’m thinking maybe something more filling. Do you have pizza?”
The waiter, unfazed, says, “Of course, sir. Let me update your order.”
He hurries back to the kitchen, and now the chef has to scrap the soup. He turns off the stove, throws out the broth, puts away the vegetables. He sighs but quickly shifts gears, rolling out dough, preparing the toppings.
But then… you start overthinking again.
“Waiter! Waiter!”
The waiter comes rushing back, “Yes, sir?”
You frown at the menu. “You know, pizza is great, but I just realized—I’m trying to cut back on gluten. Do you have steak?”
Now, the waiter, still patient but slightly amused, nods and says, “Absolutely, sir. I’ll change your order.”
Back in the kitchen, the chef sighs again. He tosses the half-prepared pizza into the trash, wipes down his workstation, and starts over—seasoning a steak, preheating the grill, making the perfect sides.
At this point, the restaurant staff is doing everything they can to fulfill your wishes—but YOU are the problem.
Each time they start preparing exactly what you asked for, you change your mind.
And here’s the kicker:
After a while, you get frustrated.
You start wondering, “Why is my food taking so long? Why am I still hungry?”
The answer is simple: you kept restarting the process.


How This Relates to Manifestation
This is exactly how most people approach manifestation.
They tell the universe, “I want success.”
The universe starts rearranging things, sending opportunities their way.
But then they hesitate.
“Wait, maybe success will take too much effort. Maybe I should focus on love instead.”
And so, the universe shifts gears, working on bringing love into their life.
But then, again, they change their minds.
“Actually, maybe I should just focus on financial freedom.”
And each time they do this, they reset the entire process.
The secret of all masters is that they never change their minds. Once they make a choice, they stick with it. The moment you stop changing your mind, reality bends in your favor.
So let me ask you:
Are you placing an order and letting it be prepared? Or are you constantly changing your mind and wondering why nothing is happening?

Our Recent Masters of Manifesting Seminar

The universe doesn’t respond to confusion. It responds to clarity.

Vishen

Subject Lines:
✅ Can Your Home Make You Smarter, Healthier, and Happier?
✅ The Hidden Ways Your Home Affects Your Energy (And How to Fix It)
✅ Why Your Home Might Be Secretly Draining Your Energy—And How to Fix It

Hi (Name),
What if your home could make you healthier? What if it could help you think better, age slower, and feel more alive—just by existing?
Most people don’t realize just how much their living space affects them. The air they breathe, the water they drink, the way their home is arranged—it’s all either supporting their energy or quietly draining it.
I used to think a home was just a home. A place to sleep, eat, and store way too many Amazon impulse buys. But then I stepped inside EYWA, and everything I thought I knew about living spaces changed.
Nestled in the heart of Dubai, EYWA is not just another luxury residence—it’s a revolution in conscious living. Part home, part sacred space, part longevity center, it’s designed to activate your highest potential. It’s a new building concept that recently won an Award at the London Property Awards for being the BEST new building development in the world.

And once you see this….you can never again see buildings in the same way. 




EYWA isn’t just a luxury residence.
It's a living, breathing ecosystem—designed to heal the human body and soul.
And visiting the EYWA showroom in Dubai made me realize just how important it is to design our own living spaces to optimize our energy, creativity, and longevity. 
In this email, I want to share what I’ve learned—not just from EYWA’s visionary creator, Alex Zagrebelny, but also from Mindvalley author Marie Diamond, whose work is about bringing ancient wisdom on energy and space into the modern world.

Eywa: The True Luxury of Tomorrow
Buildings That Support Well-Being, Longevity, and Spiritual Growth
Imagine stepping into a space that doesn’t just house you—but heals you.
A place where the air feels alive, the water nourishes you at a cellular level, and the very walls seem to whisper ancient wisdom.
This isn’t a futuristic fantasy.
It’s real. It’s EYWA.
And here’s what makes it even more extraordinary—it’s modeled after the Banyan Tree, known as the Tree of Life. Its intertwining structure symbolizes connection, wisdom, and renewal, creating a space that doesn’t just look beautiful—it actively nurtures your energy.

We’ve seen luxury real estate go through its fair share of trends. From branded residences tied to fashion designers to homes that feel more like art galleries.
But let’s be real—what’s the point of a high-end address if it doesn’t make you feel better, live longer, and elevate your consciousness?
The Vision Behind Eywa
Eywa isn’t just an architectural marvel—it’s a philosophy in action.
Visionary developer Alex Zagrebelny didn’t just set out to build another high-end residence. He wanted to create a living, breathing ecosystem—one that fuses ancient Vedic wisdom with cutting-edge modern science.
As Alex told me, his inspiration came from a deeply personal place:
""I looked at my wife and children and realized—I don’t want this world for them. Not like this. I wanted to create something better. A way of living that restores harmony between humanity and nature. A home that doesn’t just shelter you but elevates you.""
And so, Eywa was born.
My First Encounter with EYWA
The first time I walked into the EYWA showroom, I knew this was different.
You don’t just see it. You feel it.
The energy is palpable—like stepping into a sacred temple where every element—air, water, materials—is tuned to nourish your mind, body, and spirit.
I felt lighter. Sharper. More at ease.
It was as if my body recognized, Yes, this is how a home is supposed to feel.
And at that moment, I knew—I had to be part of this.
And not just for myself.
Mindvalley is building a Mindvalley House inside Eywa.
This will be a shared sanctuary for authors, thought leaders, and teachers visiting Dubai—a space designed for peak creativity, collaboration, and personal expansion.
But what about your home? Because you don’t have to live in Eywa to experience this level of transformation.
What Makes Eywa Unlike Any Other Place on Earth?
Here’s where things get mind-blowing. Eywa isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about longevity, well-being, and energy alignment.
Every detail has been meticulously designed to nourish the body, expand the mind, and elevate the soul.
1️⃣ The Power of Crystal Energy

At the heart of Eywa lies a 14,000 kg crystal pyramid. Yes, you read that right. Crystals aren’t just for jewelry or “good vibes”—they’ve been used in ancient civilizations to harmonize energy fields. This massive crystal core ensures that the entire building pulses with high-frequency energy.

2️⃣ Living Water for Cellular Rejuvenation
Eywa’s water system replicates Icelandic glacier water, infused with sound vibrations for optimal hydration and cellular health. Imagine every sip of water actively working to slow down aging and boost vitality.
3️⃣ Air So Pure, It’s Like Breathing in a Sacred Forest
Forget standard air purifiers. Eywa’s air system mimics the purity of an operating room, infused with negative ions that cleanse and energize—just like breathing in the fresh air of a deep forest.
4️⃣ Built with Vastu & Biophilic Design
Eywa isn’t just positioned for aesthetics—it’s aligned for energy flow. It follows the same Feng Shui and Vastu Shastra principles that ancient civilizations used to create sacred spaces.

Why Eywa Won World’s Best Property 2024
Eywa didn’t just win this title because it’s luxurious. It won because it redefines luxury.
In a world where most real estate is built for profit, Eywa is built for human evolution.
It’s designed to make you healthier, happier, and more in tune with yourself and the world.
Now here’s how to bring these principles into your own home. 

How to Bring Healing Energy Into Your Home
Not everyone can pack up and move to a high-vibrational sanctuary, but the truth is—you don’t have to. Your home, right now, has the potential to be a space that renews your energy, sharpens your mind, and even supports your longevity. The question is: Is it working for you or against you?
The good news? With just a few intentional shifts, you can transform your space into a source of power, peace, and vitality—one that actively helps you think better, sleep deeper, and feel more alive every day.



So let’s talk about how you can turn your home into a sanctuary for energy, focus, and longevity—without needing a 14,000 kg crystal pyramid (unless you’re into that).
1. Energy Harmonization with Crystals and Feng Shui Directions
Ever notice how some spaces just feel good? That’s because they’re designed to work with energy, not against it. And one of the easiest ways to fine-tune your home’s energy is through crystals and Feng Shui.
Think of crystals as nature’s batteries—constantly emitting frequencies that shift the energy in a space. But here’s the secret: where you place them matters.
Eywa isn’t just decorated with crystals—it’s built with them. The 1,450 semi-precious stones and a 14,000 kg crystal pyramid are embedded throughout the structure, designed to enhance focus, boost longevity, and balance energy.

Pic Above is the Crystal Garden at EYWA for residents to come together to relax by a fire. 

Here are some tips on using crystals in your own home. 
✔ Want to feel sharper and more focused? Place an Amethyst crystal in your success direction (as per your Feng Shui energy map). It’s known for clearing mental fog and enhancing intuition.
✔ Looking for more love and harmony? Rose Quartz in your relationship direction will soften the energy, creating warmth and balance in your home.
✔ Need protection from negative energy? Place Black Tourmaline by your front door—it acts like an energetic bodyguard, blocking unwanted chaos before it even enters.
And if you want to amplify their effects, add a small water feature nearby. Water enhances energy flow, making your crystals even more powerful.
(Side note: If you’ve ever felt like you just can’t think in a particular room, try shifting objects around—it’s amazing what a little reorganization can do for your mental clarity.)
2. Transform Your Air & Water into Living Elements
Most people obsess over what they eat and drink, but what about what they breathe?
Air and water are two of the biggest factors affecting your health and longevity—yet they’re also the most overlooked.
Let’s start with air quality. If you’re breathing in stale, toxin-filled air, it’s no wonder you feel sluggish. And here’s the kicker—indoor air is often more polluted than outdoor air (thanks to things like furniture off-gassing and chemical cleaners).
The solution? Air-purifying plants. Snake plants, peace lilies, and spider plants aren’t just pretty—they’re nature’s own air filters. Want to supercharge the effect? Invest in a high-quality air purifier to keep your space feeling fresh and light.
Then, there’s water—the foundation of your body’s energy system.
Most tap water is stripped of minerals and vitality—which means that even though you're drinking enough, your cells aren’t fully absorbing it.
A simple upgrade? Structured water systems mimic the way water flows in nature, making it easier for your body to hydrate. Or try this: store your drinking water in a glass container with a crystal inside (like clear quartz or amethyst) and play healing sound frequencies near it. Studies show that water holds memory, meaning it actually responds to sound vibrations.
If this sounds too woo-woo, just try playing 432 Hz frequencies near your water for a few days and see how you feel. You might be surprised.

3. Design to Resemble Nature
Your nervous system craves nature.
For most of human history, we lived in harmony with the earth—but now, we spend 90% of our lives indoors, disconnected from the elements that regulate our energy, mood, and well-being.
The fix? Bring nature back inside.
✔ Fill your space with plants—not just for aesthetics, but because they actively purify the air, balance humidity, and reduce stress.
✔ Maximize natural light exposure during the day (open your windows, rearrange furniture if needed) and switch to warmer, softer lighting at night to keep your circadian rhythms in check.
✔ Swap out synthetic materials for wood, stone, linen, or clay. Your body recognizes natural elements and responds to them in ways you don’t even realize.
Ever notice how a wooden table feels different from a plastic one? That’s because your body actually absorbs the energy of the materials around you. Small shifts—like switching to linen bedsheets or adding a wooden coffee table—can make your home feel instantly more alive.

Here’s an example of the living room at EYWA. Notice how much it resembles nature scenes?



4. Sound & Vibrational Healing with Feng Shui Sound Tools
Have you ever walked into a room and feel like the air is heavy? Like there’s unspoken tension lingering from an argument, or just stagnant energy sitting there?
That’s where sound healing comes in.
Sound is one of the fastest ways to shift the energy of a space. Certain frequencies—like binaural beats, solfeggio tones, and mantras—can literally rewire your brain and body at an energetic level.
✔ Start your mornings with 432 Hz music or Tibetan singing bowls to set a high-frequency tone for the day.
✔ If your space feels heavy, try sound cleansing with chimes, tuning forks, or even simple clapping. (Yep, clapping works—many cultures use this to break up stagnant energy in homes.)
✔ Place a wind chime near your window—this keeps energy flowing naturally throughout the day.
Once you start playing with sound and vibration, you’ll notice how much lighter and clearer your home feels.
Our home should be a multi-sensory experience—one that supports your well-being on every level. At Eywa, the air is infused with scents of ylang-ylang and jasmine, known to promote relaxation and mental clarity. The lighting is soft and golden, mimicking nature’s rhythms. And throughout the space, a gentle hum of 432 Hz vibrational frequencies fills the air, known for its ability to promote healing and emotional balance. This isn’t just design—it’s an intentional tuning of your body’s environment for optimal energy and focus.
5. Vastu Shastra Alignment with Feng Shui Principles
Ever feel restless in your own home—but you can’t quite put your finger on why?
It might not be you—it might be the way your space is arranged.
Vastu Shastra (India’s version of Feng Shui) teaches that even small shifts—like where your bed faces, how your desk is positioned, or where mirrors are placed—can have a huge impact on your energy, focus, and success.
For example:
👉 Your bed should face east or south for deeper, more restorative sleep.
👉 Your workspace should NEVER have your back to the door—it creates subconscious stress and reduces focus.
👉 Mirrors should never face your bed directly—this can disrupt sleep and drain your energy.
Try making a small adjustment today, and see how it feels. You might be surprised at the difference.

Your Home, Your Energy, Your Power
Your home isn’t just a physical space—it’s an extension of your energy.
And every object, material, and layout choice is either supporting your highest potential or subtly holding you back.
But you don’t need to move to a luxury healing retreat or rebuild your house from scratch.
Start small.
🌱 Bring in a plant.
🛏 Move your desk.
🎶 Play healing sounds.
💨 Purify your air and water.
These shifts add up—until your home is no longer just a place you live, but a space that actively nourishes, energizes, and elevates you.
To your highest evolution,
Vishen

The Zen Model of Growth: Do You Evolve Through Pain or Insight?
Hero banner:
Hi (name)
There’s a concept I came across years ago that completely changed how I think about personal growth. And trust me, after interviewing thousands of the world’s greatest thinkers, that’s saying something.
It comes from Zen Buddhism, and it suggests that from the moment we’re born until the day we die, there’s a force pushing us to grow.
Now, this force can be gentle—like the hand of a close friend on your back, guiding you through an open door. Or it can be violent—like the universe smacking you in the face with a two-by-four.
It all depends on one thing: How closely are you listening?
I first heard this idea from Michael Beckwith, the founder of the Agape International Spiritual Center and the creator of Mindvalley’s Life Visioning Mastery program. In one of our many conversations, he explained how we grow through two distinct experiences:
Kensho & Satori.
This idea is so powerful that once you understand it, you’ll never look at struggles, setbacks, or unexpected breakthroughs the same way again.
Let’s dive in.


The Universe Can Help You Grow in Two Ways
Imagine this:
You’re living your life, going through the motions, when suddenly—BAM!
You lose your job.
Your relationship crumbles.
Your health takes a hit.
Your business collapses.
That’s what Michael calls a Kensho moment—growth through pain.
Kensho moments are the wake-up calls we never asked for but desperately need. They’re the moments of heartbreak, loss, or failure that force us to evolve. They’re painful, but they lead to breakthroughs.
Then there’s Satori moments. These are the flashes of insight—the “aha!” moments—that shift our perception instantly. They come from deep meditation, personal growth experiences, or profound realizations.
For example:
- You attend a Mindvalley seminar, and in one session, your entire worldview changes.
- You read a book, and it unlocks a whole new level of understanding.
- You experience a deep, altered state—through breathwork, meditation, or even plant medicine—and suddenly, life makes sense in a way it never did before.



The Difference Between Kensho & Satori
- Kensho = Growth through pain (illness, heartbreak, financial struggle, failure)
- Satori = Growth through insight (meditation, learning, sudden realizations)
If you’re deeply engaged in your own personal growth, you’ll experience more Satori moments—and fewer Kensho moments.
But here’s the problem: Most people aren’t listening.
Most people live life on a hamster wheel, too busy, distracted, or stuck in routine to actively seek out growth. And when you don’t create space for Satori moments, the universe will push you in a different way—through Kensho.
Kensho: The Universe’s Tough Love
Kensho is a gradual process that often happens through the tribulations of life. A relationship breaks up, but you learn from it and your heart becomes more resilient. You lose a business, but you use the hard-earned wisdom to start your next one. You lose your job, but you learn who you are beyond your career. You suffer a health problem, but you discover personal reserves you didn’t know you had.
Kensho is the universe giving you tough love.
Most of the time, we don’t even realize it’s happening. Imagine the tectonic shifts of the continents—we can’t see them in real-time, but when we map them over centuries, we see that the entire world has changed.
That’s what Kensho is doing to you.
At the time, it feels like life is falling apart.
But looking back, you realize that these painful moments pushed you to challenge beliefs, systems, and habits that were holding you back in ways you hadn’t even realized. This is why people often talk about a “blessing in disguise” or the silver lining behind their struggles.
And here’s the crazy part: Kensho moments aren’t random.
Beckwith suggests that Kensho is actually our soul’s way of calling on us to grow.
Your soul already knows where you need to evolve. But if you’re not actively listening, it will force you to wake up through pain.

Satori: The Sudden Realization That Changes Everything
Now, Satori is the opposite.
Satori moments don’t come from pain. They come from awakening—from moments of pure insight, where everything suddenly makes sense.
These are the instant “aha” moments where you feel a shift in your consciousness.
They can happen:
- During a deep meditation or spiritual awakening
- While listening to a profound speech
- Through an altered state experience (like breathwork or plant medicine)
- When reading a book that completely shifts your perspective
- When you’re in nature, lost in a moment of deep contemplation
Satori moments feel like the universe whispering in your ear:
""Hey, you’re on the wrong path. Check out the view from this angle.""
Once you’ve had a Satori moment, the things that once held you back no longer have power over you. It’s like your mind upgrades to a higher operating system—suddenly, things make sense in a way they never did before.
Imagine you’ve been struggling with a problem for years—and then one day, in an instant, you just get it.
That’s Satori.
Dr. Beckwith once shared with me this little wisdom-bomb during an interview:
Behind every problem, there’s a question trying to ask itself. Behind every question, there’s an answer trying to reveal itself. Behind every answer, there’s an action trying to take place. And behind every action, there’s a way of life trying to be born.
That new way of life trying to be born is your calling. And who knows how this calling might influence the world and those around you?
If you were to plot your personal growth on a graph, Kensho moments would look like temporary dips, followed by sharp increases as you integrate the lessons. But Satori moments? Those would be sudden bursts of growth—instant leaps forward.



My Kensho Moment: How Pain Led Me to Mindvalley
I’ve had plenty of Kensho moments in my life.
One of the biggest happened when I was young. I suffered from terrible skin problems—so bad that I was bullied in school. I had no confidence. I felt hopeless. My mom took me to dermatologist after dermatologist, but nothing worked.
Then, one day, I stumbled upon a book on my father’s bookshelf.
It was called The Silva Mind Control Method. (Side note: Growing up in the late 80s, I read a lot more than kids do today—because back then, there was no internet or cable TV.)
One sentence in the book caught my attention.
“The skin is the organ most susceptible to human mental programming.”
Jose Silva, the book’s author, shared a visualization technique called The Three Scenes Technique (which is now in Mindvalley, by the way). It was a simple mental exercise for healing.
I had suffered from bad skin for five years.
But after practicing Silva’s method for just five weeks—three times a day, for three minutes each—my skin completely healed.
To this day, I have great skin for a man my age.
That one painful Kensho moment led me down a path of deep curiosity about the human mind. It led me to become a Silva instructor. And eventually, it led to me creating Mindvalley.
This is how Kensho works. Pain forces you to grow. But if you embrace it, it can take you somewhere extraordinary.
Why I Now Embrace Every Challenge
I’ve learned this concept so deeply that now, whenever life throws me a Kensho moment, I don’t panic.
Even when things go horribly wrong, I know there’s a breakthrough on the other side.
Yes, I still allow myself to feel the pain. But instead of seeing it as an ending, I see it as a transition—a necessary push from the universe to level up.
This is why I live with the belief that every struggle is by design.
It’s not random. It’s not pointless.
It’s happening for me, not to me.
How to Shift from More Kensho to More Satori
Most people experience more Kensho than Satori. Why?
Because they’re not listening.
They live life on autopilot, repeating the same patterns, ignoring their intuition, and resisting change—until the universe forces them to wake up through painful experiences.
But here’s the good news: You can choose to shift from Kensho to Satori.
How?
1. Commit to a Daily Meditation Practice
Meditation creates space for Satori moments. It quiets the noise and allows you to hear the whispers of insight before life has to shout at you.
2. Engage in Continuous Learning
Attend personal growth events, take courses, read books, and actively seek wisdom. The more you expose yourself to new perspectives, the more likely you are to experience Satori.
3. Build Self-Reflection into Your Routine
Journaling, therapy, and self-inquiry help you process your life’s challenges before they become full-blown crises.
4. Set Aside 20 Minutes for Mindvalley Every Day
If you’re actively learning, evolving, and upgrading your mind, the universe doesn’t need to shake things up for you through Kensho moments.
Because if you’re listening, the universe doesn’t have to smack you in the back of the head to get your attention.
Your Exercise: Mapping Your Life’s Growth
I want you to try something powerful today. It’s called The Lifeline Exercise, and it will help you recognize how Kensho and Satori moments have shaped your life.
Here’s how it works:
1. Grab a journal.
2. Draw a simple graph with time on the X-axis and your quality of life on the Y-axis.
3. Think about the last 10-20 years of your life. Identify the major moments where your life dipped (Kensho) and where it leveled up (Satori).
4. Reflect on what you learned from those moments.
When I did this, I saw clear patterns.
Some of my lowest points led to my biggest breakthroughs. And when I embraced growth, my Kensho moments became less frequent, while my Satori moments skyrocketed.
Now, I want you to try it.
And if you feel like sharing, post your Lifeline in our Mindvalley community. You never know who your story might inspire.
2 Quests to Help You Shift from Kensho to Satori
If you want to experience more Satori moments and evolve with ease, these two Mindvalley Quests will help you make the shift:
1️⃣ The Quest for Personal Mastery with Srikumar Rao
This was one of the most popular MBA programs in America—and now it’s available as a Mindvalley Quest.
Srikumar Rao blends the wisdom of ancient philosophers with modern business principles, showing you how to shift into a state of effortless growth. One of the core teachings in this Quest is the belief in a benevolent universe—the idea that life is always working for you, not against you.
➡️ If you often find yourself feeling stuck, resisting change, or experiencing Kensho moments more than Satori, this Quest will reframe your perspective and help you create a life of flow and ease.

2️⃣ Life Visioning Mastery with Michael Beckwith
If you don’t yet know where your soul is calling you, this Quest will help you uncover it.
Michael Beckwith teaches the Life Visioning Process, a transformational framework that helps you tap into your higher self and discover what your soul truly desires to accomplish in this lifetime.
➡️ Rather than waiting for painful Kensho moments to push you forward, this Quest helps you proactively align with your highest vision—so you can step into your soul’s purpose without struggle.

With Mindvalley Membership, you get full access to both.

Preheader:
Losing weight isn’t about willpower or exercise—it’s about rewiring your relationship with food. And today, I have incredible news: WildFit is now included for free in Mindvalley Membership.
A Big Announcement for the Mindvalley Community


Every year, we improve and expand Mindvalley Membership to make it the most valuable personal transformation platform on the planet.
And today, I’m excited to share one of the biggest health upgrades we’ve ever made.
WildFit—our premium $800 health and nutrition program—is now included free in Mindvalley Membership.
If you’re a Mindvalley Member, you now have access to a program that has already transformed over 100,000 lives—including mine.
If you’ve struggled with weight, cravings, low energy, brain fog, or aging faster than you’d like—this is the program that can help you reset your body and health.
If you haven’t heard of WildFit before, let me share why this program changed everything for me.
The Moment I Knew Something Had to Change
It was January 2016, and I had just turned 40.
That morning, I looked at myself in the mirror.
And I wasn’t happy with what I saw.
22% body fat. My waistline had expanded and despite working out two to three times a week, my body wasn’t where I wanted it to be.
I had a sugar addiction. Every afternoon at 5 p.m., I would reach into my desk drawer for a Mars bar just to get a sugar spike to push me through the day.
I was aging faster than I wanted to admit. My hair was graying, and I was even noticing a bald spot forming.
Despite being someone who optimized every part of my life, my body wouldn’t cooperate.
I followed what I thought was a healthy diet:
- Cereal or a fruit shake for breakfast
- Two Starbucks lattes throughout the day
- Lunch of meat, chicken, or rice
- A home-cooked dinner—usually Indian, Thai, or Western cuisine
I wasn’t overeating, yet I felt sluggish, low on energy, and constantly in need of caffeine or sugar to function.
That’s when I met Eric Edmeades.
The Unexpected Meeting That Changed Everything

[banner]
A few weeks later, I attended a Transformational Leadership Council event, a private gathering of some of the world’s top coaches, authors, and personal growth leaders.
That’s when I saw Eric Edmeades being called on stage to receive an award.
He wasn’t a doctor. He wasn’t a fitness trainer.
But he had transformed the health of dozens of people in that very room.
Naturally, I was intrigued.
I went up to him and asked, “Eric, what exactly do you do?”
And he said something that completely changed how I thought about health:
“Vishen, 85% of weight loss has nothing to do with exercise. It’s all about food.”
At first, I didn’t believe him.
We’ve been told for years that weight loss comes from exercise, discipline, and willpower.
But Eric wasn’t just making claims. He had spent years studying indigenous tribes, like the Hadza Bushmen in Africa—one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer societies.
These people never counted calories. They never went to the gym. They didn’t follow diets.
Yet they were lean, strong, and full of energy.
Eric realized that modern humans are trapped in a broken system—one that makes us crave unhealthy foods, get addicted to sugar, and feel guilty when we don’t have the willpower to “eat better.”

Worse - the modern media machine then tells us that the way to lose weight is through exercise. This is why so many food companies like Nestle and Coca Cola sell disgustingly unhealthy products but then sponsor sporting events. The idea is to shift the blame from ‘bad foods’ to ‘you’re not exercising enough.”
This is where Eric’s work comes in. 
He created WildFit as a way to reset the body’s natural relationship with food.
I decided to give it a try.
The 90-Day Transformation That Shocked Me
I started WildFit in February 2016.
Within 90 days, everything changed.
- My body fat dropped from 22% to 15%—without increasing exercise.
- My energy levels skyrocketed—I felt like I was in my 20s again.
- My mental clarity improved—flow states became effortless.
- My sugar cravings disappeared—I no longer needed my afternoon Mars bar.
- My hair stopped graying—even my bald spot started filling in.
And the most surprising part?
It wasn’t hard.
I didn’t count calories. I didn’t struggle with willpower. I didn’t force myself to exercise more.
WildFit wasn’t a diet. It was a complete reprogramming of how I thought about food.

With some vulnerability I’d like to share my before and after pics taken during and after the Wildfit program. 

The first pic is during week 5 of Wildfit (before the weight loss kicks in). 22% bodyfat. 
The second pic is after I finished the program. Now at 14% bodyfat. Excellent for a man over 40.
The final pic is what happened post-Wildfit when I started doing the 10X program on Mindvalley to gain more muscle. 

How WildFit Transformed My Family & Team
After seeing my results, I had to share WildFit with my family.
So I put both my mom and dad on WildFit.
- My mom lost 5kg (12 lbs) and looked healthier than she had in years.
- My dad’s energy surged—he could climb stairs effortlessly again.
One day, he told me, “To hell with what the doctor said. I’m going to live to see my grandkids grow up.”

That’s when I realized that WildFit isn’t just about weight loss—it’s about longevity.
I then introduced WildFit to my Mindvalley team, and here’s what happened:
- One designer lost 90 lbs in 6 months. 
- Two programmers set a record in our tech team for both losing 51 lbs in 3 months.
- Several people reported better skin, hair and even mental clarity. 
So in August of 2018, we decided to bring WildFit to Mindvalley. The initial program was $1500 when it first launched for the 3 month transformation.
And in the last seven years, it has transformed over 100,000 lives.

Why WildFit Works When Every Other Diet Fails
Most diets rely on:
Restriction & willpower (which only makes you crave the foods you’re avoiding) Intense exercise (which isn’t necessary for weight loss)
Short-term results (where you lose weight, but gain it all back)
WildFit is different.
It’s built on Behavioral Change Dynamics—a powerful framework that helps you rewire how you think about food.
Here’s what makes it unique:
No calorie counting (because restriction creates cravings)
No exercise required (movement is encouraged, but weight loss comes from food)
No hunger (if you’re hungry, you’re doing it wrong!)
Behavioral change techniques (so you no longer want unhealthy foods)
The “Seasons” model (teaching your body when & how to eat for optimal health)
That’s why WildFit has a 97% completion rate—one of the highest of any health program in the world.

The WildFit program is packed with eye-opening insights about food, nutrition, and how our bodies are designed to eat. 
Here are some stunning facts from the program:
1. Sugar is More Addictive Than Cocaine
📌 (Lesson 6: Understanding Cravings)
Studies show that sugar triggers dopamine release in the brain, making it more addictive than some drugs. Many processed foods are designed to keep us hooked. Why do you think sugar is in 70% of the typical American grocery store products? It gets you to BUY more. 
2. Humans Are the Only Species That Eat Against Their Instincts
📌 (Lesson 3: The Six Human Hungers)
Unlike animals, humans eat based on emotions, habits, and marketing—often ignoring true nutritional needs. Understand how emotions are tied to your cravings and you end the cravings. Example - ice cream and chocolate are seen as comfort food by many because these foods were given to us as children to make us calm down or feel better. 
3. The ""Balanced Diet"" Myth Was Created by Food Companies
📌 (Lesson 8: The Food Industry’s Influence)
The food pyramid was heavily influenced by corporate interests, promoting grains and dairy over fresh, whole foods. 
4. Seasonal Eating is Hardwired into Our DNA
📌 (Lesson 10: The Power of Spring, Summer, and Fall Foods)
Our ancestors naturally ate different foods in different seasons. WildFit teaches how mimicking this cycle can help with fat loss, energy, and long-term health.
5. Fat Isn’t the Enemy—Sugar Is
📌 (Lesson 12: Fats vs. Carbs in the Body)
For years, fat was demonized, but it's actually crucial for brain function, hormones, and energy. The real culprit behind obesity and chronic disease? Processed carbs and sugar.
6. Food Cravings Are Often Nutrient Deficiencies in Disguise
📌 (Lesson 7: The True Meaning of Hunger)
Cravings for chocolate? It might be a magnesium deficiency. Craving salty chips? Your body could be needing minerals, not junk food.
7. Dairy is Not as Essential as We Were Told
📌 (Lesson 14: The Dairy Deception)
Most humans are lactose intolerant to some degree. Milk is designed for baby cows, not humans—yet it's marketed as a ""must-have"" for strong bones.
8. Your Body Can Switch to Burning Fat Instead of Sugar
📌 (Lesson 16: Entering the WildFit Spring Phase)
The body naturally runs better on fat than on sugar. By reducing sugar intake and eating real foods, you can train your body to burn fat efficiently.
Want to go deeper? WildFit helps you reset your relationship with food and reclaim your natural instincts. 🚀🍏

Pre: The $12,000 Mistake and Why You Should Think Twice About GLP-1 Drugs
WildFit vs. Ozempic: The Truth Big Pharma Won’t Tell You
Mindvalley family,
Let’s talk about something that could change your life.
Right now, millions of people are turning to GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro to lose weight. The promise? A simple injection that curbs your appetite, melts away fat, and makes cravings disappear. Sounds amazing, right?
I thought so too. Until I interviewed this man last night. 
The interview is live on Youtube and it’s 25 mins and truly worth a watch. 


Link to the Youtube Video here.
Now for your convenience I wanted to share the key ideas from this interview with you in today’s newsletter. The person I’m speaking to is Eric Edmeades. The brilliant transformational architect who created Wildfit. Eric’s process of teaching people how to lose weight has been so effective he’s been awarded a medal by the Canadian Senate and invited to speak at the Parliament in the UK. 

Our interview last night happened randomly. We were filming something totally different and Eric said “Vishen, if you have time, I really want to share some important information on Ozempic.”
I’m glad I said yes. I’m sharing the interview as a video on Youtube (25 mins) (link here) and in summarized form in this email. 
Now Eric created Wildfit. So Wildfit is a competitor to Ozempic. I just want to be clear about this upfront. But what I like about Wildfit is that it creates long term results and is natural and safe. And it’s also now included in Mindvalley Membership so if you’re a member you don’t have to pay anything extra. 
And on the other hand with Ozempic (a type of GLP-1 medicationmeditation) …
GLP-1 drugs cost a staggering $11,000–$12,000 a year in the U.S.
They come with serious side effects—muscle loss, nausea, fatigue, and even long-term risks like thyroid cancer.
And worst of all? They’re designed to be a lifetime prescription. Once you start, stopping becomes nearly impossible.
Watch the Full Interview Now
I've placed the full 25-minute interview on YouTube, where Eric and I break down:

 ✅ How GLP-1 drugs trick your body into losing weight
 ✅ The shocking long-term risks (that nobody talks about)
 ✅ Why WildFit can naturally trigger the same response—without the need for medication
Or if you prefer reading, here’s the summarized transcript of our conversation:
Interview: Vishen Lakhiani & Eric Edmeades on WildFit vs. GLP-1 Medications
Interview: Vishen Lakhiani & Eric Edmeades on WildFit vs. GLP-1 Medications
Vishen Lakhiani: Mindvalley members and aspiring members, today’s conversation is a game-changer. We’re in a world where people are jumping onto medications like Ozempic and Mounjaro to manage their weight. But at Mindvalley, we believe there’s a better way. That’s why I’m speaking with Eric Edmeades, founder of WildFit, a program that’s transformed over 150,000 lives over the past nine years.
1. Vishen: Eric, I want to dive right into it. These GLP-1 drugs are everywhere, but you say they’re unnecessary. Why?
Eric Edmeades: Simply put, we can trick the body into thinking it’s already taking one of these medications—without the actual drug. GLP-1 medications work by making you feel full, but they’re essentially tricking your body into thinking it’s nourished. The good news? We can achieve the same biochemical response naturally with the right nutrition and metabolic approach.
2. Vishen: That’s fascinating. But let’s take a step back—what exactly is a GLP-1?
Eric: GLP-1 stands for glucagon-like peptide-1. It’s a natural peptide your body produces when you eat certain foods, signaling that you’re full. These drugs are synthetic versions of that peptide. It’s like tanning in the sun versus using a tanning bed—one is natural and beneficial, while the other is an artificial substitute with potential side effects.
3. Vishen: So let’s talk about those downsides. A lot of people are saying GLP-1 is working for them, but they’re also paying somewhere around $11,000 a year. That’s the average price in the U.S., right? But then there are all of these side effects, and, like many pharmaceuticals, these drugs are designed to be taken for life. What are some of the side effects here?
Eric: First, they don’t just reduce fat—they reduce overall body mass, including muscle and bone density. That’s a major issue because muscle mass is directly linked to longevity and healthspan.
Then there are the immediate side effects: nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and a total loss of interest in food. That last one may sound like a dream for someone struggling with cravings, but it’s actually a nightmare. GLP-1 drugs suppress nutritional hunger but do nothing for emotional hunger. People still reach for comfort foods, but now they’re eating even less of the nutrient-dense foods their body actually needs.
4. Vishen: That’s scary. But are there psychological side effects as well? You speak so much about how food is psychology in WildFit.
Eric: Absolutely. These drugs weaken your willpower. When you artificially suppress your cravings, you don’t build the executive function necessary to manage food choices. And here’s the kicker: The part of the brain that controls willpower for food also controls willpower for everything else—exercise, productivity, relationships. So as willpower weakens, so does your ability to make strong decisions in other areas of life.
5. Vishen: That’s scary. And what about long-term side effects?
Eric: It’s funny—there is a lot of focus on short-term side effects because people tend to think short-term. But there are now studies suggesting increased risks of thyroid cancer, pancreatic issues, and severe muscle loss. Muscle mass is directly correlated with healthspan and longevity—so if you’re losing muscle, you’re essentially accelerating aging. Anything that threatens your muscle mass is something to think twice about.
6. Vishen: And a lot of people who take these drugs seem to get stuck. They have to keep taking them, it’s expensive, and then they have long-term side effects. Why do people seem unable to stop taking them?
Eric: Think about it this way—when you take a drug that artificially suppresses your appetite, you don’t have to exercise any willpower. Your executive function gets weaker. When people stop the drug, their appetite seems to come back stronger. But it’s not that the cravings have intensified—their ability to resist has weakened.
7. Vishen: So if we decide not to go down the GLP-1 path, how do we activate the same quality in our body naturally?
Eric: GLP-1 is a synthetic mimic of a peptide we already make when we eat certain foods. If we prioritize those foods, our body produces the same response—without the need for an injection. Nutrient-dense foods, healthy fats, and proteins trigger this naturally. On the other hand, processed foods and sugar do the opposite and make you hungrier.
8. Vishen: You also mentioned the concept of timing your meals and breaking free from processed food. How are these related?
Eric: Most of the food in grocery stores today is designed for profitability, not nutrition. It’s nutritionally empty and full of addictive substances that stimulate appetite. But there’s also a timing issue—ancestral food patterns show that our bodies aren’t designed to eat first thing in the morning or snack late at night. If we align our eating patterns with how our metabolism evolved, we can achieve better health and natural appetite regulation.
9. Vishen: So, final question for you, Eric. What would you say to someone who’s thinking about taking GLP-1 right now?
Eric: If you haven’t started yet, I’d strongly recommend going through WildFit first. By week six or seven, you’ll have triggered the same response in your body naturally, and you won’t need the drug. If you’re already on it, speak to your doctor about slowly weaning off while implementing WildFit principles. We’ll help you through that process so you can regain control without being dependent on the medication.
10. Vishen: That makes absolute sense. Before committing to something with such radical side effects, high costs, and long-term risks, people should try something like WildFit first.
So the kickoff class for WildFit is happening shortly. All you have to do is sign up using your Mindvalley membership. And again, it’s a 90-day program. Commit to doing it now. WildFit won’t disrupt your schedule—it will actually enhance your mental clarity, focus, and sleep. The results start happening before the end of the first month.
Eric, this has been eye-opening. Thank you for comparing Ozempic and GLP-1s with WildFit—I’ve learned so much from this conversation.
So as you can see GLP-1 medications are not as innocent as they are made out to be. 
But what if I told you there’s a natural, more effective way to achieve the same results—without the injections, the side effects, or the cost?
This is why we’re bringing WildFit to every Mindvalley member for free.
Why WildFit is Now Part of Your Mindvalley Membership
When we first launched WildFit, it was a game-changer. It was one of the most powerful nutrition programs ever created.
People were paying $1,500 to go through it, and the results were nothing short of stunning. Later, we brought the price down to $800, when we reached 150,000 Wildfit graduates making it more accessible.
Now, we’re taking things one step further.
WildFit is now INCLUDED in Mindvalley Membership.
That means instead of paying $800—or spending over $11,000 a year on GLP-1 drugs—you can start right now, for free as part of your membership.
If you’re not a Mindvalley member yet, the cost of joining is a fraction of what one month of GLP-1 drugs would cost. And I promise you—WildFit is just as, if not more, effective.
That’s why I produced this interview with WildFit founder Eric Edmeades—to help you see the truth about GLP-1 drugs before making a life-altering decision.

The Personal Growth Playbook of Donald Trump

This newsletter is going to be different. 
Whether you love him, hate him, or just enjoy the spectacle, there’s no denying that Donald Trump is one of the most fascinating figures in modern history. He’s not just a politician. He’s a brand, a movement, a force of nature.
And if you strip away the noise—the politics, the scandals, the larger-than-life persona—you’re left with something undeniably interesting: a personal growth strategy that has propelled him from real estate mogul to reality TV star to President of the United States… and back to the political arena again.
Now, before you throw your phone across the room or start composing an angry tweet, let me be clear: this is NOT an endorsement or a takedown. This is an exploration. A deep dive into the four rules that have shaped Trump’s worldview and, in turn, his success.
So let’s step back from politics for a moment.
What if, instead of judging, we simply observed? What if we looked at Trump—not as a politician—but as a case study in personal growth, influence, and the psychology of success?
What if we examined his mindset?
Because here’s the truth: The man has defied every expectation, broken every rule of conventional leadership, and still remains one of the most influential figures on the planet. He has lost and won, been written off and resurrected, faced scandals and indictments—and yet, his grip on his followers is unshakable.
So, what’s his secret?
What guiding principles have shaped him into the force he is today?
And perhaps most importantly—is there anything we can learn from them?
Visiting Mar-a-Lago & the movie The Apprentice

The picture i took of Trump from my iphone when he joined our dinner

I got a firsthand glimpse into Trump’s world when I was invited to Mar-a-Lago a few months ago. I also have friends who have worked with him, been in meetings with him, and even done business deals with him. The insights they’ve shared with me paint a fascinating picture.
But what really sparked this letter was watching the film The Apprentice. The movie explores Trump’s relationship with the infamous American lawyer Roy Cohn, a man who once defended the mafia and was an ally of Senator Joseph McCarthy during the communist Red Scare in America.
The acting in the film was phenomenal— and the actors Sebastian Stan as Trump, Jeremy Strong as Cohn delivered Oscar-worthy performances. 
But what struck me the most about the movie wasn’t just the acting—it was how it depicted Trump’s evolution. It showed his transformation from an eager, sweet, and somewhat naïve young man into the relentless, larger-than-life force he eventually became.
At the heart of it all were three laws that Roy Cohn imparted to Trump. These three rules—plus a fourth one that I picked up from reading The Art of the Deal years ago—form the foundation of Trump’s personal growth philosophy.
Are you ready? Buckle up.

Who Was Roy Cohn?

To understand Trump’s personal growth philosophy, you need to understand Roy Cohn. If Trump is the ultimate showman-turned-politician, Cohn was the mastermind behind the curtain.

Cohn first rose to prominence as Joseph McCarthy’s chief counsel during the infamous Red Scare, where he helped orchestrate the anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s. He was ruthless, unapologetic, and had a simple rule—never admit defeat, never apologize, and always attack.

When McCarthy fell from grace, Cohn reinvented himself as a power broker in New York, working as a mob lawyer and rubbing shoulders with the rich and powerful. It was during this time that he became Donald Trump’s mentor.

Cohn taught Trump how to weaponize the legal system, how to manipulate the press, and—most importantly—how to create an untouchable personal brand. He wasn’t just Trump’s lawyer; he was his strategist, consigliere, and attack dog all rolled into one.

Cohn had three ironclad rules. Rules that Trump absorbed like a sponge.
1. Attack, Attack, Attack
2. 
3. Admit Nothing, Deny Everything
4. 
5. Always Claim Victory
6. 
And then, years later, Trump added his own fourth rule—one that would become his ultimate superpower.
1. Relentless Optimism
2. 
These four rules became the foundation of Trump’s personal philosophy. And whether you agree with them or not, you can’t deny their impact.
Ironically, Cohn’s own downfall mirrored the tactics he taught Trump. In 1986, he was disbarred for unethical conduct—fraud, perjury, and unethical business practices. His response? Complete denial. Even as his career crumbled, he insisted he was the victim of a political conspiracy.

Trump absorbed all of this. And even after Cohn’s death from AIDS in 1986, his influence lived on in Trump’s philosophy of power and survival.

In the movie The Apprentice, it’s suggested that Cohn mentored Trump and asked him to follow the following 3 Rules of Life. 

Rule #1: Attack, Attack, Attack
In The Art of War, Sun Tzu wrote:
""Opportunities multiply as they are seized.""
In other words: Never play defense. Always strike first.
This was Roy Cohn’s number one rule, and Trump didn’t just adopt it—he made it his core philosophy.
If you observe Trump’s career, you’ll see one pattern repeating over and over again: He never waits for an attack. He preempts it. He overwhelms. He escalates. He turns every battle into a scorched-earth war.
I had a fascinating conversation about this with Richard Branson on Necker Island in September 2024. Branson—who has been quite vocal about his distaste for Trump—shared something revealing.
During the 2016 elections, both Trump and Hillary Clinton invited him to separate meetings.
When he sat down with Hillary, she spoke about governance, strategy, innovation, and policy.
When he met with Trump? The entire conversation was about revenge.
Trump listed people who had wronged him, one by one, and described exactly how he planned to destroy them.
Branson walked out of that meeting shaken.
He had never met someone so singularly obsessed with retaliation.
But here’s the thing: It worked.
Trump’s relentless attacks obliterated his political rivals. In 2016, one by one, every Republican candidate who stood in his way was demolished.
This isn’t just politics. This is branding warfare.
Robert Greene, in The 48 Laws of Power, puts it this way:
“Crush your enemy totally.”
Trump doesn’t just defeat opponents. He erases them from relevance.
But what about those who stand with him?
That’s a different story.
At Mar-a-Lago, I saw this firsthand.
I had been invited to a private dinner for an incoming governor in March 2024. The attendees were some of the most politically influential people in America. And while I didn’t necessarily share their political views, I found them to be polite, warm, and genuinely kind individuals.
But the conversations? Fascinating.
One person confidently told me that 350,000 Chinese operatives had crossed the U.S. border and were waiting for China’s signal to attack America.
Another person claimed that two million terrorists were currently hiding within the United States.
Someone else insisted that Biden wasn’t actually running the country—that Barack Obama was secretly in charge, funded by George Soros.
Now, let’s be clear—I don’t think these beliefs hold up under objective scrutiny.
But what struck me was this: These weren’t angry, aggressive conspiracy theorists. They were polite, rational, and open to discussion.
When I questioned some of their claims, they listened. No tension. No fights. Just discussion.
And then, Trump walked in.
The energy in the room shifted instantly.
I have only seen a handful of people who radiate this level of charisma in person. The Dalai Lama is one of them.
As he greeted the crowd, he pointed at us and said:
""I love you!""
The room exploded.
""We love you, Mr. President!""
 ""We’re with you till the end!""
It was a level of loyalty that is extremely rare for any leader.
Regardless of what you think of him, Trump’s magnetism is undeniable.
But here’s the paradox: If you oppose him, he will try to destroy you.
And in American politics, that Machiavellian strategy has proven to be highly effective.

Rule #2: Admit Nothing, Deny Everything
If Rule #1 is about overwhelming your enemies with force, Rule #2 is about something even more powerful: controlling reality itself.
This is Roy Cohn’s second golden rule, and Trump has turned it into an art form.
The rule is simple: Never admit fault. Never concede. Deny everything. No matter what.
This isn’t just about avoiding accountability. This is about bending reality to your will.
And Trump has done this over and over again, with astonishing effectiveness.
Let’s look at some of the most infamous examples.
Case Study: The Lawsuit That ""Never Happened""
One of Trump’s earliest legal battles came in the 1970s when the U.S. Department of Justice sued Trump’s father’s company for racial discrimination in housing.
Trump’s response?
They didn’t just deny the charges—they counter-sued the U.S. government.
Eventually, the Trumps settled. But how did Trump spin it?
""We didn’t lose. We won.""
Factually, this was untrue. But in Trump’s world, it became true.
And this pattern would repeat throughout his entire career.
The 2020 Election: The Ultimate Reality Distortion Field
Nowhere is this rule more evident than in Trump’s handling of the 2020 election.
Every court ruling, every recount, every single legal fact pointed to the same conclusion: Trump lost.
And yet, to this day, millions of people still believe he won.
Why?
Because he never admitted defeat.
Instead, he reframed the entire election as a stolen victory. He flooded social media with claims of fraud, manipulated perception, and planted a seed that no amount of evidence could uproot.
This is the power of Rule #2.
If you simply refuse to acknowledge reality, you force the world to choose: Do they believe their own eyes? Or do they believe you?
And if you’re charismatic enough, bold enough, and unyielding enough—people will believe you.
Trump’s Superpower: The Ability to Rewrite History in Real-Time
A few months ago, I spoke to a seminar organizer who used to book Trump for speaking events before he became President.
He told me something mind-blowing.
There was a seminar where 8,000 people attended.
After the event, he followed Trump back to his suite for a quick chat.
Trump picked up the phone, called Melania, and said:
""Can you believe it? 18,000 people showed up to see me!""
Now—Trump knew the real number.
The seminar organizer was sitting right next to him.
And yet, in that moment, Trump rewrote the past.
Not out of forgetfulness. Not out of a simple exaggeration.
But because, in his mind, 18,000 was now reality.
And this is where Trump does something most people can’t comprehend:
He doesn’t just lie—he creates a new truth.
Most of us, when confronted with reality, adjust our beliefs. Trump does the opposite.
He adjusts reality to fit his beliefs.
The Big Leap: Trump and the Absence of an ""Upper Limit""
Now, let’s pause for a moment—because there’s a fascinating personal growth concept at play here.
Gay Hendricks, in The Big Leap, talks about something called the Upper Limit Problem.
The idea is that most people have an internal thermostat for success, happiness, and self-worth.
When we exceed that limit—whether it’s a big career win, a massive relationship breakthrough, or a financial windfall—we subconsciously sabotage ourselves to return to our comfort zone.
Trump?
He has the opposite problem.
He doesn’t see limits at all.
He expands reality to fit his version of himself.
Call it narcissism. Call it delusion.
But the reality is—it works.
Because the world believes the people who believe in themselves the most.
This brings us to…
Rule #3: Always Claim Victory
There’s a phrase in branding and persuasion that goes like this:
""It’s not about the truth. It’s about the truth people believe.""
And no one embodies this more than Trump.
Roy Cohn’s third golden rule was simple but incredibly effective: No matter what happens, always claim victory.
Even when you lose.
Even when the facts say otherwise.
Because here’s the secret: People don’t remember details. They remember the story. And the story that wins is the one told with the most conviction.
Trump understands this better than almost anyone alive.
He doesn’t just claim victory—he does it with so much confidence that people start questioning reality itself.
The 2020 Election: The Biggest “Victory” That Never Happened
Let’s take a step back to the 2020 election.
By every possible metric—legal, statistical, factual—Trump lost.
The courts ruled against him. Recounts confirmed the results. Every piece of credible evidence pointed to the same conclusion: Joe Biden won.
But Trump never conceded.
Instead, he reframed the loss as a fraudulent victory.
He planted the idea that the election was stolen, and once that narrative took hold, no amount of evidence could shake it. And here’s what’s absolutely mind-blowing—millions still believe it.
Not because the claim was supported by facts. But because it was delivered with conviction.
This is why Trump is still the dominant force in Republican politics today. Because he never allowed himself to be seen as a loser. In the world of influence and personal branding, losing is often worse than being wrong. And Trump knows that.
The Bankruptcy “Wins”
The 2020 election wasn’t the first time Trump rewrote history in real-time. In the 1990s, his business empire was crumbling.
- His Atlantic City casinos were bleeding money.
- 
- He filed for multiple bankruptcies.
- 
- His investors lost billions.
- 
For most business leaders, this would have been the end. But not for Trump.
He never admitted failure. Instead, he rebranded bankruptcy as a genius business move. He walked away from his casino failures richer than before—while his investors got wiped out.
But if you ask him? He’ll tell you he won. And because he never acknowledged defeat, most people never saw him as a failure.
The Inauguration Crowd That “Grew” on Its Own
One of the most blatant examples of this rule happened on Trump’s first day in office.
During his inauguration, news outlets published aerial photos comparing his crowd size to Obama’s 2009 inauguration.
And the difference was clear: Obama’s crowd was far bigger.
So what did Trump do?
He simply declared that his crowd was the largest in history. Even though the photos proved otherwise.
Rather than backing down, his press secretary doubled down on the claim. Suddenly, the conversation wasn’t about policies, the economy, or the future—it was about who had the biggest crowd.
And by the time the media finished arguing about it, Trump had already moved on.
The Power of Reframing Reality
The lesson here isn’t just about Trump.
It’s about human psychology.
- Entrepreneurs sell themselves as billionaires before they hit their first million.
- 
- Athletes visualize their victories before stepping onto the field.
- 
- CEOs project confidence in their startups, even when their companies are burning cash.
- 
Because here’s the truth: Winning is often a matter of perception. And if you can control the perception, you can control reality.
When This Works (And When It Doesn't)
Now, this rule is incredibly powerful—but it has two sides.
If you declare victory with conviction, you can:
✔️ Attract investors who believe in your vision.
 ✔️ Build momentum even when the odds are against you.
 ✔️ Create the feeling of winning—which often leads to actual success.
But there’s a dark side: delusion.
If you keep claiming victory even when reality is crumbling, eventually, the truth catches up.
- Investors stop believing in you.
- 
- Employees lose faith.
- 
- Your empire collapses.
- 
So the real question isn’t just, “Does this work?”—because it clearly does.
The real question is: How far would you take it? Because once you start bending reality, it’s easy to lose sight of the truth altogether.
And that leads us to Trump’s final rule—his true superpower.


Rule #4: Relentless Optimism
Roy Cohn taught Trump how to attack and deny, but the fourth and final rule in Trump’s personal growth playbook comes from a very different source: Norman Vincent Peale, the pastor who shaped Trump’s core belief system.
Peale’s philosophy, outlined in The Power of Positive Thinking, was radical self-belief taken to the extreme. His mantra? “If you think it, it will be so.” In other words, reality bends to the will of those who believe hard enough. And Trump has lived by this principle his entire life.
The Power of Positive Illusions
This explains why Trump’s many financial collapses never seemed to faze him. Even when his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt, he walked into meetings projecting absolute confidence—so much so that banks kept lending him money. He convinced investors that failure wasn’t real because, in his mind, it simply wasn’t an option.
And it wasn’t just business—this mindset shaped his entire approach to politics. Take his presidential campaign in 2016. Pundits laughed at the idea of a reality TV star with no political experience winning the White House. The media dismissed his campaign as a joke. And yet, Trump acted as if victory was inevitable from day one. His supporters felt his confidence, and that belief became contagious.
Failure? What Failure?
Most people, when they suffer a public failure, go into damage control. They issue apologies, explain their mistakes, try to win back credibility.
Not Trump.
When something doesn’t go his way, he simply acts like it never happened. His businesses collapse? “That was a smart business move.” His administration fumbles a policy? “It was actually a huge success.”
And here’s the wild part—people buy it.
Psychologists call this “positive illusions”, a cognitive bias where people who maintain extreme optimism—even in the face of failure—end up influencing reality itself. When a leader truly believes they are winning, they can convince others to follow them—even if the facts say otherwise.
Trump’s Ultimate Psychological Shield
One of the most fascinating things about Trump’s relentless optimism is how it serves as a psychological shield.
A former White House aide once described watching him walk into a meeting completely unprepared, bluff his way through, and leave convinced he had dominated the room. He had no self-doubt. No hesitation. Just pure, unshakable confidence.
And the thing is, this kind of mindset is scientifically proven to work. Studies have shown that leaders who project confidence—whether or not it’s justified—are perceived as more competent. Even when they fail, people see them as visionaries rather than frauds.
The Real Lesson: When Optimism Becomes Delusion
So, does relentless optimism work? Absolutely. It keeps you moving forward. It makes failure feel like a temporary inconvenience rather than a real setback. It builds an aura of invincibility.
But there’s a fine line between optimism and delusion.
At some point, reality catches up. Investors pull out. Supporters grow skeptical. And if you’ve built your empire entirely on positive illusions, the crash can be catastrophic.
So, the real question isn’t whether Trump’s relentless optimism is effective. 
The question is: How far would you take it?

Final Thoughts: 

Would You Use These Rules?

Trump’s rules—Attack Relentlessly, Deny Everything, Always Claim Victory, and Stay Relentlessly Optimistic—aren’t just political tactics. They are principles of influence, branding, and personal resilience that have been used by leaders, CEOs, and power players throughout history.
These rules have built billion-dollar empires, crushed opposition, and propelled him to the highest office in the world. They are also rooted in psychological strategies that have been used by the most powerful figures throughout history—from military generals to corporate titans to media moguls.
But they also come with a cost.
When you attack relentlessly, you create enemies who never forget. When you deny reality, reality eventually catches up. When you always claim victory, you risk delusion. And when you stay relentlessly optimistic, you walk a fine line between confidence and blind arrogance.
Yet, these strategies work—at least for a time. And perhaps that’s why Trump, even in the face of indictments, bankruptcies, and political defeats, remains as influential as ever.
And here’s the thing. If you had asked me before that evening in March 2024 at Mar-a-Lago, I would have said—without hesitation—that I was anti-Trump. Not because of his policies, not because of his party, but because I had assumed he was a vengeful, hateful man. Someone so consumed by anger and ego that being in a room with him would be suffocating.
But that wasn’t the man I met. The Trump I saw was the exact opposite—charismatic, warm, full of high energy. And honestly? He was just fun to be around. Not the monster I had expected.
And it wasn’t just him.
I had also assumed that the MAGA movement was filled with narrow-minded conspiracy theorists, racists, hateful and delusional people who saw the world in extremes. But the people I met in that room weren’t like that at all. They were kind. They were generous. They were intelligent. They operated from a different set of facts, yes—but they were open to discussion. They listened. They debated politely. They were willing to engage.
That night, I had to confront an uncomfortable truth about myself.
A lot of the conclusions I had made about Trump and his followers came from one side of the media. And that had shaped my worldview into a rigid, binary perspective—where certain politicians were good and others were evil.
But life isn’t binary. Everything lies on a spectrum.
And in that spectrum are shades of gray—nuances that get erased when we let ourselves be polarized.
That night, I left with a newfound conviction: the moment you label one side as “good” and the other as “bad,” you stop seeing reality. You stop analyzing people for who they actually are, and instead, you judge them based on the version of them you’ve been fed.
I no longer see the world that way. And I don’t think anyone else should, either. Because the best way to truly see the truth about someone isn’t to assume. It isn’t to rely on what you’re told. It’s to analyze them yourself—to look at them with an open mind, to see both their light and their shadow, and to recognize that we all exist somewhere in between.
So, the real question isn’t just whether these rules work.
The real question is: Would you use them? 
If you would or wouldn’t, Click here let me know in the comments. 
Because at the end of the day, power isn’t about being right—it’s about knowing how to play the game.

By Vishen Lakhiani

Pre: This is for the ones still hiding their brilliance – By Vishen Lakhiani
I want to speak to the founders today.
The entrepreneurs. The coaches. The creators are building something real—something that matters.
You’ve poured your soul into your product, your service, your mission.
But let me ask you this:
Why isn’t the world hearing you?
I’ve met so many brilliant people with game-changing ideas... who freeze the moment the camera turns on.
They hesitate.
They doubt.
They overthink.
And in a world where attention = trust = traction, silence is the fastest way to disappear.
This newsletter isn’t a list of hacks.
It’s a call to step up.
Because I’ve been there.
I spent years building Mindvalley from behind the scenes.
 Wrote the copy. Scaled the business. Changed lives.
 But I wasn’t the face of anything—because I didn’t feel ready.
I didn’t think I had the look.
 Or the voice.
 Or the presence.
 Or whatever “it” is that thought leaders are supposed to have.
Spoiler alert: none of that mattered.
But it took me five key moments to learn that.
Moments that helped me stop hiding, start sharing, and grow an audience of millions—in a niche people once told me was “too small.”
So if you’re building something you care deeply about…
 And still hiding from social media—overthinking your voice, your face, your age, your accent, your lighting, your cat walking across the screen…
I get it.
Because that was me.
Recently.
And what changed everything weren’t tactics.
They were stories.
Let me tell you the five that changed everything.
👇 Keep reading.

1. 🔧 Everything You Think You Suck At… Is Hackable
The year was 2017. I was at one of our events in Portugal. The theme? ""Expand Your Influence.""
Jay Shetty was there. A former monk turned social media juggernaut. Great voice. Great hair. Looks like he drinks charisma for breakfast.
After the event, I sat down to interview him.

Now picture this: Jay’s sitting upright, wearing a perfect outfit, talking like a polished philosopher who moonlights as a GQ model.
And me?
I looked like I’d just stopped by the clearance rack at H&M.
I was interviewing Jay Shetty on how he became a viral superstar. 
My posture was hunched. My voice was rushed. My shirt had probably been in my closet since the Obama administration. I hadn’t styled my hair. Or maybe I had, but it gave up on me halfway through.
At some point, I told him:
""Jay, I don’t have your look. Or your voice. Or your storytelling style. I’m 40. You’re 32. I’m too old for this. Who's going to listen to me on Instagram?""
And Jay—with his usual kindness and just a hint of “stop being an idiot”—goes:
""That’s the silliest thing I’ve ever heard.""
Then he gave me a crash course in how to show up. Seriously.
He taught me how to slow down my voice. How to sit with intention. How to use a blow dryer (I was 40 and didn’t own one). He literally showed me, step by step, how to get my hair to stand up like his.
This, my friends, was my bromance makeover moment.

And you know what I learned?
Everything is hackable.
Your voice. Your posture. Your presence. Your confidence. Even your hair.
You don’t have to be born with it.
You can build it.
A few weeks later I released my first Instagram post for the public. 

A few months later I released my first viral video (a campaign ad against Nestle). It received 50 MILLION views. My life was about to change….

And all it took was for a friend to pull me out of my fears. 

2. 🏹 You’re Not Trying to Reach the World. Just Your World.
Let me tell you something strange about me:

I’m obsessed with Mongol and Hellenistic history.
No, really. Obsessed. I once flew to Uzbekistan just to walk the lands where Genghis Khan marched his army. No one asked me to do that. There was no business reason. I just needed to be there. Nerd pilgrimage.
And here’s the crazy thing:
I follow small social media accounts that post about this stuff. Super niche. Sometimes low production value. But I follow these accounts of historians and tour guides because…
They speak to me.
They’re not trying to be for everyone. They’re for people like me. Central Asia history nerds. 
That’s the real secret of social media.
You don’t have to be the next Tony Robbins or Marie Forleo or Alex Hormozi.
You just have to be you—loud enough for your people to find you.
That’s the biggest mindset shift I had to make.
You’re not posting to impress the masses.
You’re posting to attract the weirdos who see the world like you do.
And trust me, they’re out there. Probably scrolling right now. Waiting for a voice like yours.
No matter how small or weird your passion. There are people just like you out there (fellow weirdos in the best way) waiting for you to share. 
3. 🩸 How Losing Everything Made Me Step Up
Let’s rewind to 2014.
Mindvalley had just lost its biggest revenue-generating program: The Silva Method.
Ten years of partnership. Gone. Just like that.
The new CEO of Silva decided to take it all in-house. Poached two of my employees. Cut me out.
It wasn’t just a business hit. It was personal.
We started losing money. Fast. I had to lay off 18 employees in Argentina.
And I remember sitting there thinking:
“I have no main author. I have no program. I have no face for the company.”
And then, life forced the question:
“What if the face… is me?”
I’d already paid $10,000 to a book marketer. I asked him for a refund.
He said no.
But he offered me something better:
“Why don’t you write the book yourself?”
So I did.
That book was The Code of the Extraordinary Mind.

It went on to become a global bestseller.
 Hit #1 on Kindle.
 It was translated into over 25 languages.
 It opened doors I never imagined.
But here’s the real moral of the story:
If you lose the platform—become the platform.
Entrepreneurship isn’t about being safe. It’s about being seen. Especially when everything feels uncertain.
Have you been behind the scenes? Are you truly happy there? Do you feel there’s something prodding you to step up, to get on stage, to speak out your thoughts? 
Perhaps it’s time. 
4. 🎥 No One F*cking Cares. Just Start.
Let me introduce you to Klemen
Klemen is from Slovenia. He used to work at Mindvalley. He’s also one of the most courageous students I’ve seen in our Social Media Mastery program.
Why?
Because in Week 1—before we even taught him anything—he posted his first video.
His outfit? Let’s just say... it could’ve been a shepherd's costume.
His accent? Heavy.
His lighting? Boldly experimental.
His delivery? Honest and raw.
Was it perfect? No.
Was it viral? Also no.
But was it real?
Yes. And that’s why it worked.
See, Klemen didn’t wait until he had the right camera, the right look, the right filter.
He just started.
And here’s what you need to hear:
No one f*cking cares if you’re not polished.
Your tribe doesn’t want a brand.
They want a human.
Start awkward.
Start shaky.
Start cringe.
But start.
5. 💥 The Hair Dryer That Taught Me the 3-Second Rule
Want to know what one of the most viral videos I ever made was about?
Hair.
Specifically—a joke video on how I get my hair to stand up.
Jay Shetty trained me. (Yes, really.) He showed me the trick with warm and cold blow-drying.
So one day, I decided to film a video explaining it.
But I didn’t open with:
“Hey guys, let me tell you how I style my hair.”
No.
I opened with:
“This is the weirdest thing Jay Shetty ever taught me…”
Boom. Hook.
You have 3 seconds to stop the scroll.
Most people start with:
“Hi, I’m Sarah, and today I want to talk to you about…”
No one hears the rest.
But if you open with something unexpected, weird, or curious—now you’ve got them.
The 3-second rule isn’t just a trick. It’s a superpower.
Here’s an example - this video about our upcoming Social Media Summit is crushing it in ads. All because I started in a way that’s weird and unexpected. 

🎯 Final Thought for Entrepreneurs:
I’m not telling you to go viral.
I’m telling you to go visible.
To stop hiding behind product features and polished branding.
 To show your real face. Your messy passion. Your imperfect genius.
If you want to grow your brand, your mission, your impact in 2025…
You need to get on camera.
You need to tell stories.
 You need to build trust.
 You need to connect.
And the truth is—you’re ready.
You’ve always been ready.
You just needed someone to call you out.
So consider this your callout.

“You were not born to play small. You were born to disrupt, to heal, to lead, and to ignite.”
 — Vishen Lakhiani, Mindvalley Social Media Summit 2025

Let’s be honest.
You felt it too, didn’t you?
You attended the Social Media Summit. You were lit up. Expanded. Awakened to what’s possible. You saw the speakers stand boldly in their message — no filters, no scripts, just soul.
And then… the next day, when you went to hit “record” on your phone or write that vulnerable post, something in your body said:
“Nope. Not safe. Not today.”
That. Right there. That’s the visibility wound.
And it’s more real than most people talk about.
This Isn’t Just About Social Media
At the summit, we weren’t just talking about tactics.
We weren’t just learning hooks, captions, and growth strategies.
We were being called into something deeper.
We were being asked:
🌀 Will you let yourself be truly seen?
🌀 Will you stop hiding behind overthinking and finally speak your truth?
🌀 Will you own that you’re here for a mission — and that the only thing standing in the way is the fear of being visible?
What came up for many of us wasn’t just resistance.
It was old wounding — deep in the nervous system, layered in shame, cloaked in perfectionism, and inherited through generations.
And if that’s you…
You’re not broken.
You’re not lazy.
You’re not “not cut out for this.”

You’re just holding an unhealed visibility wound.
What Is the Visibility Wound?

It’s the fear that if you are seen for who you truly are, you will be judged… or rejected… or ridiculed… or abandoned.
It’s that subtle dread that lives between the spark of your genius and the moment of pressing “share.”
It’s your inner child remembering the time they raised their hand and got laughed at.
It’s your nervous system recalling the ancestral memory of being silenced, shamed, or punished for speaking truth.
It’s the voice in your head that says:
 ✨ “You need to be more polished.”
 ✨ “You need more followers first.”
 ✨ “You’re not ready yet.”
But none of that is your truth.
It’s your conditioning. Your trauma. Your protection mechanism is trying to keep you safe from a threat that no longer exists.
The Moment I Saw My Own Wound
When I was teaching on stage during the Mindvalley Social Media Summit, I had a moment. A crack in the system — in my system.
I realized: I too have the visibility wound.
A teammate pointed it out to me — gently, but directly.
And to be honest, it stung.
They said, “Vishen… you do realize you suffer from the visibility wound too?”
“What do you mean?” I asked, slightly defensive.
And they replied:
“You literally hosted the CNN Global New Year Countdown — broadcast to hundreds of millions of people around the world.
 You were just on the cover of Global Citizen Magazine this week.
 And you didn’t share either of those on Instagram.”
Oof.
They were right.
I hadn’t updated my personal site, vishen.com, in years.
I hesitate to share my own newsletters on Instagram.
And some part of me — the part that prides itself on staying grounded, authentic, human — quietly resists posting anything that might seem… “too shiny.”
Why?
That question sat with me.
Am I afraid that if I look too successful, I’ll become unrelatable? That I’ll break trust with those who’ve journeyed with me from the early days?
Maybe.
I’m still exploring that.
But here’s what I know: I took the note.
And this weekend? I posted that magazine cover.
 I posted the CNN New Year Countdown the same day.
Because visibility is not vanity — it’s service.
 It’s modeling freedom.
 It’s showing others what’s possible.
So if I — someone who’s built a global brand around transformation — still bump up against this wound… could it be showing up in you too?
Let me remind you:
This isn’t about algorithms or aesthetics.
 This is about freedom.
 The freedom to show the world who you are — without shame, without apology, and without fear of abandonment.
It’s not just a post.
 It’s a reclamation.
Visibility Is the Gateway to Everything You Desire
We’ve all heard it now, again and again, from the summit stage:
“The algorithm doesn’t reward perfection. It rewards authenticity.”
 — Brendan Kane
This is not about becoming an influencer.
This is about owning your identity as a creator — because creators change the world.
Your next client… your next opportunity… your next quantum leap…
They’re not waiting for you to be perfect.
They’re waiting for you to be real.
And that only happens when you heal the fear of being seen.
Why Do So Many of Us Struggle With This?
Because for many of us, visibility didn’t feel safe growing up.
🧠 If you were told to be quiet, you learned to silence yourself.
🧠 If you were only praised for being perfect, you learned to hide your messy truth.
🧠 If you watched others get torn down for standing out, you learned to stay small.
And then — we try to launch brands, start businesses, share messages…
 All while that inner child, or that ancestral trauma, or that energetic block whispers:
“If they see the real you… you won’t be loved.”
As one commenter in our Social Media Summit chat said
“This explains why I can teach others to shine but struggle to post myself.”
 — Theresa Lee
And that’s the lie we’ve all internalized.
But the truth is this:
Being seen doesn’t mean being exposed. It means being revealed.
The Summit Cracked Something Open
In the Zoom chat, people were feeling it:
“My voice is needed.” — Yennifer
“Screw my fear of being seen.” — Maria Rahayuni
“This explains everything.” — Theresa Lee
The wound was being named. And once named… it started losing power.
Because this isn’t just about content.
It’s about liberation.
Every time you post something real? You reclaim a piece of your voice.
Every time you show your face? You rewire your nervous system.
Every time you speak your truth? You undo generations of silence.
The New Paradigm: Visibility as Healing
If you’re a business owner I want you to reflect on this post by Mastin Kipp. I shared this on my phone on Day 2 of the Social Media Summit.
 
So let’s not LIE to ourselves. It’s not procrastination. It’s FEAR. 
And it’s time to heal this wound. 
🔮 Every time you post, you’re not just creating content — you’re reclaiming your voice.
🔮 Every time you show your face, you’re not just growing your brand — you’re reprogramming your nervous system to believe it’s safe to be seen.
🔮 Every time you speak your truth, you’re not just expressing yourself — you’re healing generations of silence.
This is not just about visibility.
This is about liberation.
From the inner critic.
From the fear of judgment.
From the old story that says you must be small to be safe.
You Are the Medicine
If you’ve been wondering whether your story matters — it does.
If you’ve been thinking the world doesn’t need another coach, healer, artist, entrepreneur — it does.

But what it really needs is more truth.
More vulnerability.
More realness.
You don’t have to be “big” to be impactful.
You just have to be visible enough to be found by the people you’re here to serve.
“Just get started. Even if it’s messy.”
 — Sunbird Hill Team (Uganda)
“Nobody cares. Just post it. Just start.”
 — Jessica Momodu
So let this be your permission slip:
🌟 To speak even if your voice shakes.
🌟 To post even if you don’t have a strategy.
🌟 To show up even if you’re still healing.
Because your voice isn’t meant to be polished.
It’s meant to be felt.
Final Words (Read This Slowly)
The visibility wound is real.
 But so is your power to heal it.
Start small.
Start scared.
Start anyway.
And remember:
This isn’t about performance.
It’s about presence.
Let’s stop hiding.
Let’s turn platforms into portals.
Let’s use our voice — not for validation, but for liberation.

Pre: A data-backed approach to the future we’re capable of creating by Vishen Lakhiani
A Case for a Borderless World (And Why Walls Are the Real Threat to Humanity)

Let’s get this out of the way: Borders are BS.
They’re imaginary lines drawn by dead men in wigs and kept alive by people in fear. They exist on maps but not in the hearts of the evolved.
And yet, we worship them like holy commandments. We let them define who gets access to safety, love, wealth, healthcare, and freedom.
Let’s break the spell.
A borderless world isn’t just a utopian ideal whispered by John Lennon and the Federation in Star Trek—it’s a data-backed, spiritually aligned, economically smart direction for humanity.
And yes… It’s the opposite of what Trump is trying to do to the world.
I started reflecting on this post today while at Singularity University in Silicon Valley, attending a dinner with fellow execs and tackling a very unique dinner table conversation.
On our table was a conversation starter card that made the nerd in me light up:
What can business leaders learn from the original Star Trek series?

My response to the question? 

Let’s slowly dismantle borders. Bit by bit. 

Let me explain. 

Why Do We Believe in Borders?
Ready for an entertaining ride on why we might want to reconsider how we tie our identities (and our mental models of how we understand others) to these imaginary lines? Buckle up.
In my book The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, I use a term called brules (short for bullsh*t rules) to describe useless laws and rules we humans still cling to in simplistic attempts to make sense of a complex world. The idea of borders is one of the biggest brules out there.
We worry about immigrants flooding into our civilized countries and raising crime rates.
We fear that refugees will leech off public funds and allow their exotic but alien cultures to taint our pristine way of life.
We worry that our ways will be replaced by people with a different skin color or who worship God based on a different ancient text.
In short: we fear.
But is this fear irrational?
Turns out, in a study of how much we truly understand the world—conducted by Swedish social scientist Hans Rosling—we’re basically clueless.
We have what’s called a negative bias toward the world. And these three facts show just how wide the gap is between reality and perception.
So I want you to do this quiz with me. Real quick. Answer these three questions:
1. What percentage of the world lives in poverty today?
2. What percentage of the world population now lives in a country other than their country of birth?
3. What’s the birth rate per woman outside the Western world?
Got your answers down? Okay, now let’s check your score.
Three Beliefs That Fuel the Fear of “A Borderless World”
1. The Myth of Global Poverty
In a 2018 study asking 32,000 people from 26 countries whether world poverty had increased or decreased over the prior 20 years—only 2% got it right.
The truth? Global poverty dropped from 40% in 1980 to under 9% today.
We’re living through the greatest poverty reduction in human history—and hardly anyone knows.
I was sitting in an Uber in Tallinn just a few months ago when the driver asked, “You’re of Indian origin, correct?”
I said, “Yes.”
He then proceeded to say, “Indian. Such friendly people. Pity your country is so poor. People suffer so much. Ah, the poverty. Very bad. Very bad.”
What my European Uber driver failed to understand was this:
Poverty rates in India have fallen so sharply that today only 2% of Indian households live on under $2/day—the global measure for extreme poverty.
Poverty is falling globally. But if Westerners think the world is swarming with starving, poor, decrepit souls seeking better chances… you’re going to shut your borders tight.

2. The Myth of Migration
According to Rosling’s data in Factfulness, only 3.4% of the global population lives outside the country they were born in.
That means 96.6% of humanity stays put. Most people want to stay home—they just want the opportunity to thrive while doing so.
Contrary to popular belief, millions of people aren’t trying to sneak into your rich country. They’re busy making life better and better in their own. 
India, China, the Middle East —all are experiencing tremendous bursts in quality of life and GDP. And fewer and fewer of them care about the “American Dream”. 

3. The Myth of “Baby Machines”
It’s common in the West to assume that people in India and the Muslim world have truckloads of kids. And if you let “those people” into your country—oh no! Prepare to be replaced.
Turns out this is far from true.
Today, the global average fertility rate is 2.1—exactly at replacement level.
And shockingly this includes countries like Pakistan, Nigeria, and Bangladesh.
Let me repeat that: Westerners and non-Westerners are both barely having children… at replacement level.
The exception? 9% still living in extreme poverty. When your child has a high chance of dying before age 5, you procreate more.
So why are Westerners so wrong?
Simple: right-wing politics in the US and Europe thrive on fear. 
The most useful fear? The fear of the other.
Western media is designed to make its citizens fearful, insular, and… let’s be honest—proudly ignorant.
Let’s rewind…
The American Border Crisis Was Manufactured
Hear me out for a moment…
The U.S.-Mexico border is one of the most emotionally charged political issues in America today. But what if the ""crisis"" dominating headlines was, in fact, a problem created by the very people who claim to be solving it?
Back in the 1980s, America didn’t have a border wall—and didn’t need one. 
Mexicans would cross over, work as day laborers, and then return home.
There was even a term for it: rotating door migration.
During the 1980 Republican presidential primary debate in Houston, Texas, on April 23, 1980, candidates Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush engaged in a surprisingly humane exchange about immigration—particularly concerning undocumented immigrants. Both emphasized compassion and practicality.
George H.W. Bush said:
“These are good people, strong people. Part of my family is Mexican.”
Ronald Reagan added:
“Rather than talking about putting up a fence, why don’t we work out some recognition of our mutual problems, make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit?”
Imagine that. Reagan, patron saint of modern conservatism, advocating for migrant workers—not demonizing them.
He didn’t see immigrants as threats. He saw them as neighbors.
He believed in circular migration—that workers could come to the U.S. temporarily, contribute, and return home without being criminalized. No walls. No mass deportations. Just legal, respectful cooperation.
But something changed.
🧱 What Changed? The Politics of 'Control'
By the mid-1980s, immigration had become a political lightning rod. The economy was under strain. Unemployment was up. And the media narrative started shifting from “hardworking migrants” to “illegal invaders.”
Even though Reagan held personal compassion, he faced growing pressure from within his own party to “restore control.”
So in 1986, Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)—a sweeping law that did two things:
- Legalized about 3 million undocumented immigrants already in the U.S.
- Criminalized hiring undocumented workers and increased border enforcement.
Reagan called it a “humanitarian” measure. And in many ways, it was.
But it came with a price.
🔁 The Unintended Consequence: From Circular to Permanent Migration
Before IRCA, Mexican workers would come seasonally—they’d work for months, then return to Mexico. It was a rotating door.
But after IRCA’s enforcement kicked in—especially employer sanctions and increased militarization of the border—crossing became riskier, costlier, and far more dangerous.
So what happened?
Migrants stopped going back. They brought their families and settled permanently.
The very enforcement meant to “control” immigration actually cemented it.
Sociologist Douglas Massey put it best:
“We transformed a circular flow of male workers into a settled population of families.”
So Reagan’s legacy is complicated.
He wanted openness and dignity. But in trying to appease both sides, he set in motion the very crisis the right wing would later weaponize.
Fast forward 30 years.
The GOP has gone from Reagan’s “Let’s work together with our neighbors” to Trump’s “Build the wall.”
From compassion… to cruelty.
From policy… to panic.
From work permits… to cages.
Reagan wasn’t perfect. But he never wanted a wall. He didn’t dream of bans and raids. He believed immigrants made America stronger.
What changed?
Fear won.
Fast forward to today:
Right-wing politicians have mastered this fear-based playbook.
Enter Trump. Enter JD Vance. Enter tariffs, bans, walls, and panic.
All built on useful myths.
The Real Stats: Illegal Immigrants Are Not the Problem
Contrary to campaign soundbites:
- Illegal immigrants do not commit more crime.
- They’re not causing rape waves.
- And most of those horror stories? Fabricated. Recycled political fiction.
Now, here’s a dose of reality:
Each year, undocumented immigrants in the U.S. contribute over $10,000 in taxes per household, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. That’s more than some citizens pay—and they do it while being ineligible for most public benefits.
They pay income taxes, property taxes (through rent), sales taxes, and Social Security—even though they’ll likely never see a dime of it in return.
So again—who’s really freeloading?
Americans are good, kind people. They get this. Even many who voted for Trump—when presented with the realities undocumented families face—respond with empathy. In fact, when asked about what should happen to undocumented immigrants already in the U.S., 70% of Americans said they preferred a pathway to citizenship over deportation. But at political action rallies? We see the dark side. (Some politicians bring out the worst in us.)
We’ve built a mythos around the “drain on the system” when, in fact, they are helping keep the system afloat—from farming to food service, from childcare to construction.
And let’s be honest: if you live in the U.S. and enjoy affordable strawberries in winter, a clean hotel room, or a well-maintained garden, you’re already benefiting from undocumented labor.


The Fear Machine Reloaded: Trump’s Tariffs and Global Poverty
And now, fear takes another form: economic warfare dressed up as patriotism.
Trump’s tariffs weren’t a strategy. They were a tantrum—one that tanked the stock market, raised consumer prices, disrupted global supply chains, and risked plunging the world into disconnection and poverty.
Why?
Because American voters fell for it. (Again. Sigh.)
These weren’t smart, tactical moves to protect American jobs. They were emotionally charged, fear-fueled maneuvers designed to punish an imaginary enemy called “everyone else.”
The result? Tariffs that cost the average U.S. household $400–$500 a year in added expenses. Billions in lost business. And a breakdown in trust with global trading partners.
Borders—which were being gently dissolved by global trade and digital collaboration—are rearing their ugly heads again.
And it’s hurting everyone.
Which brings us to the trillion-dollar question—the one that could redefine the future of our species if we’re brave enough to answer it honestly…
What Happens If We Erase Borders?
According to economist Michael Clemens, global GDP could double.
That’s not a typo. Double.
Because when people are free to move to where their talents are most needed, productivity soars. Innovation spreads. Opportunity multiplies.
And some economists take it even further: some models estimate global GDP could grow by up to 147% if we opened borders worldwide.
That’s not just a bigger pie. That’s a whole new global bakery franchise.
Borders trap potential. 
They lock brilliant minds and strong hands in environments where their contributions are stunted. 
But when we unlock that movement—
We don’t just help migrants. We lift everyone.
It’s the closest thing humanity has to a cheat code for prosperity.
So, what’s stopping us?
Fear. Again. But we’ve already seen what fear costs.
Now imagine what courage could gain.


Star Trek: The Federation of Us
In Star Trek canon, Earth unifies in the year 2150—just 125 years from now. And soon after, it joins the United Federation of Planets.
No more nations. No more borders. Just one species, one mission: to boldly go where no one has gone before.
The Federation isn’t just science fiction.
It’s a map. A metaphor. A model.
At the heart of this galactic alliance lies a Vulcan philosophy: IDIC—Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations.
The idea? That every culture, every perspective, and every being—no matter how strange or different—adds richness to the whole.
That diversity isn’t something to tolerate. It’s something to celebrate.
That’s not just fantasy—it’s the future we’re capable of creating.
In a way, the Starship Enterprise wasn’t just a ship. It was Earth, evolved. A planetary crew navigating the galaxy with wisdom, inclusion, and curiosity as their compass.
And maybe—just maybe—it’s a glimpse of who we’re meant to become.
Not someday. But soon.
Because the Federation already exists in pieces: in our shared values, our intercontinental friendships, and the billions of us who already see ourselves not just as citizens of nations but as humans of Earth.
And it’s already starting to happen. 
Schengen: The Real-World Federation
Want proof that borderless living isn’t just sci-fi? Look at the Schengen Zone in Europe.
Every single day, 3.5 million people cross internal EU borders without showing a passport. No barbed wire. No interrogations. No identity theater.
I once road-tripped with my kids from Belgium to the Netherlands to Luxembourg to Germany to France—all in the span of 8 days by car. Not a single checkpoint. Not a single customs agent. Even my European SIM card worked seamlessly across countries. Not even a roaming fee to annoy me.
This is what happens when countries collaborate instead of compete.
Now contrast that with post-Brexit Britain:
- British families now face long lines at EU airports.
- They need visas to work abroad.
- Their economy? Shrinking.
UK households are now losing £1,300 a year in income due to reduced trade and investment.
If the average Brit who voted for Brexit had known their holiday in Spain would come with longer queues and a lighter wallet… would they have still voted for it?
Probably not.
The entire thing was built on a lie.
A lie stoked by—yes, again—right-wing politicians who used the fear of “others” to harvest votes.
And now, it’s the everyday people paying the price.
Dubai: A Case for Openness
If there’s a real-world prototype of Star Trek’s United Federation of Planets, it’s Dubai.
The Emiratis make up only about 8% of the population. The rest? A swirling dance of humans from every continent—working, co-creating, and building a future together.
Crime? Lower than most major Western cities.
Cultural erosion? Nope. Emirati identity isn’t just intact—it’s celebrated, respected, and globally influential.
Economy? Absolutely booming.
Dubai consistently ranks among the top 10 safest cities in the world, beating out cities like London, Paris, and New York. So much for “diversity brings danger.”
While much of Europe is aging, shrinking, and clenching its borders like a scared fist, the UAE opened its doors—and opened its future.
This isn’t an anomaly. It’s a blueprint.
I’ve made Dubai my home, and more and more of my friends, co-workers, and many Mindvalley authors are now moving there. Openness simply works!
Darwin Was Right: Evolve or Die
In 1872, Charles Darwin wrote one of the most prescient paragraphs I’ve ever read in any book. In The Descent of Man, he wrote:
“As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation... Once this point is reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races.”
Darwin didn’t just predict evolution.
He predicted the European Union.

He didn’t just see where we came from. 
He saw our future. 
He saw that empathy expands with civilization.
That artificial barriers—like borders—block our most evolved instinct: sympathy.
And what did the British people do with that legacy?
They voted for Brexit.
Yes, Charles Darwin—voted one of the greatest Britons of all time—was spiritually slapped in the face by a nation that let fear rewrite its future.
As Professor Scott Galloway put it:
“Brexit is the greatest act of national self-sabotage since America invaded Iraq.”

Side note: Trump’s tariffs may prove to be an even greater—and dumber—act of self-sabotage.
Why I Wrote This (And Why I Carry 5 Residencies)
As an entrepreneur who’s created jobs across four continents, let me give you a real-world example of how fear-driven bureaucracy plays out:
- It took me two days to get residency in the UAE.
- It took me 419 pages of documentation and months to get the same in the United States.
- It’s taken me nearly a year (and counting) to secure residency in London, just so I can be present for my daughter, who is enrolling in school there.
This isn’t about the immigration “process.” This is about paranoia disguised as policy.
These outdated systems were designed for a world that no longer exists—a world run on fear, not facts.
I’ve lived on multiple continents. I’ve created jobs in countries that won’t give me citizenship. I’ve contributed millions to economies where I still get treated like an outsider.
And I know I’m not alone. This is the daily reality for millions of people like me: global citizens trapped by 20th-century paperwork.
This isn’t about process—it’s about paranoia.
These bureaucracies are relics of a world run by fear, not facts.
The Earth Flag I Fly
That’s why the only flag I’ll ever truly fly is the Earth Flag.
Designed by Swedish artist Oskar Pernefeldt, it features seven interlocking white rings on a deep blue background—symbolizing the unity of continents and all life on Earth.

It’s an amazing idea worth following. I simply don’t believe in the idea of countries anymore. I love the USA, Estonia, Malaysia, the UAE – all the countries that I’ve called home. But I choose to see myself as a citizen of Earth first. 
And if this idea resonates, follow the Earth Flag on Instagram here:

So… What Now?
Let’s recap:
- Borders are fiction.
- Fear is the author.
- And the future belongs to those who can imagine beyond the lines.
It’s time to:
✅ Stop letting fear choose your leaders.
✅ Demand policies rooted in facts, not fiction.
✅ Stop voting for anyone who says ‘tariffs,’ ‘border wall,’ or ‘migrant invasion.’ They don’t have a vision. They have a marketing plan.
✅ Choose Earth. Choose openness. Choose evolution.
Because the greatest wall we need to tear down… is the one in our minds.
And on the other side?
The next version of humanity.
One world. One people. No borders.
Only horizons.

Sub: This is Where You Belong This Summer

Preheader: When 300 people joined me in Spain, I knew we were onto something. Welcome to the story of Mindvalley University.

It Started as a Wild Experiment…
Now It’s One of the Most Transformational Experiences in the World
Let me take you back to early 2016.
At the time, I was living in Malaysia. My kids were going to an American school. Life was good—but something inside me felt stuck. You probably know that feeling.
Same meetings. Same conversations. Same coffee shop.
No matter how much you achieve, a quiet voice whispers:
 “There’s more.”
I wanted to shake things up. I wanted to give my children a broader view of the world—and maybe start a new family tradition.
So I came up with this idea:
Every summer, we’d move to a different city for one month. A new place. A new culture. A shared experience.
But the more I thought about it, the more I realized…
That could feel isolating.
My kids love making friends. I thrive in the community. Exploring a city alone—especially as a family—can get lonely fast.
So, what if…
What if we didn’t do it alone?
What if other families joined us?
What if people passionate about growth, learning, and adventure could come together in one city?
I had visited Barcelona before, and the city had blown me away. The beauty, the vibe, the culture—it was the perfect place to begin.
So I opened Facebook and typed a post in February 2016.
“Hey everyone—this summer, I’m moving to Barcelona for a month with my kids. Want to come too?”
I thought 20 people might be interested.
Instead, 170 people commented saying they just might do it.
And I laughed to myself:
“Liars.”
Back then, I wasn’t that well-known. My book hadn’t hit #1 on Amazon. Mindvalley Membership hadn’t even launched yet. Most people knew me as a successful online blogger—but not someone you’d move countries to be with.
But here’s where it gets wild: 
300 people actually came. 
Yes, 300 PEOPLE MOVED TO BARCELONA WITH ME. 
And just like that… a spontaneous experiment turned into something extraordinary.
Image Below: The original post that started the movement:

The First Summer: The Barcelona Experiment

We weren’t sure what we were doing. There was no roadmap, no structure. Just a bunch of us moving to a city with hope, curiosity, and kids in tow.
We rented Airbnbs in the same neighborhood.
We turned a co-working space into a shared campus.
We set up a classroom for our children.
And I called a few Mindvalley authors—Lisa Nichols, Marisa Peer, and others—and asked them to join us in Barcelona.
To my surprise, many of them said yes.
They flew in to teach, speak, and hang out. Not for fame. Not for money. But because they believed in the vision: a better way to live and learn, surrounded by community.
In that one month:
People created mastermind groups in coffee shops.
They hosted spontaneous workshops in their apartments.
New businesses were launched.
Children formed friendships that felt like summer camp—but way more conscious.

And at the end of it all… people cried.
Not because it was over.
But because they had experienced something they didn’t even know they were missing.
They had found a tribe.
They had rediscovered their spark.
They had felt fully alive—maybe for the first time in years.
That month became known as “The Barcelona Experiment.”
And it lit the fuse for what would eventually become Mindvalley University.
Why We Called It a University (Even When It Wasn’t)


When I saw what was happening, I went to my team.
“Can we create some infrastructure around this? We have 300 people in Barcelona. Let’s give them something more.”
So we launched a project: Mindvalley University.
We called it a “university” not because it was academic, but because it felt like we were all students again—learning, growing, and reimagining life together.
That summer, we built: A co-working campus for the adults, A classroom space for the kids, A community experience unlike anything I had seen before
And something clicked.
We weren’t just on vacation. We were reinventing education.
We were rediscovering life.
Mindvalley University Today

Since 2017, Mindvalley University has grown into an annual tradition.
Every summer—except during the pandemic—we choose a new city and transform it into a living, breathing, global campus.
We’ve gathered in:
- Tallinn, Estonia
- 
- Pula, Croatia
- 
- Lisbon, Portugal
- 
- … and now, in 2025, we’re heading to Amsterdam.
- 
This isn’t a conference. It’s not a retreat
.
It’s a 2-week immersive experience of what life could be like—if learning, family, health, and personal growth were at the center.
Do you want to learn more about how to get there?
This Isn’t Just for Families

Here’s something most people don’t realize:
Yes, we created MVU with families in mind. But today:
- 80% of participants come as individuals or couples.
- 
- 20% come with children and get access to our incredible youth programs.
- 
- Many are digital nomads, creators, entrepreneurs, or just curious seekers.
- 
Everyone comes for one thing: Reinvention
A new model of living, learning, and belonging — that society easily suppresses out of us. 

Learn more on how you can break the cycle.
Why It Changes You

You learn from top teachers by day.
You connect with visionary minds over dinner.
You explore a city not as a tourist—but as a co-creator.
And what happens is subtle… then seismic.
You shift. You expand. You remember who you really are.
This year, in Amsterdam, we’ll gather from August 4–17 to do it all again.
MVU Is a Talent Incubator

One of the most magical things about MVU is how it creates leaders.
It doesn’t just attract talent—it activates it.
🎤 Jimmy Naraine came as an attendee—now he’s a bestselling author and Mindvalley trainer.
 🎤 Dawn Hoang showed up as a student—today, she’s a sought-after intuitive advisor and kundalini activator.
 🎤 Regan Hillyer attended quietly in the early years—now she’s one of the most in-demand manifestation coaches on the planet.
 🎤 Niraj Naik found his spark here—now known globally for SOMA Breathwork.
At MVU, we don’t just bring in world-class teachers. We discover them.
If you have something powerful to share, we’ll give you the space to teach, inspire, and transform others. 

All you have to do is get a ticket to attend MVU Amsterdam and apply with us to speak. 
This Is a Playground for Creators
There’s something magnetic that happens when you bring 1,500 conscious creators into one space.
YouTubers film their breakthroughs. Podcasters record in-the-moment realizations.
Writers fill journals with lightning-bolt insights.

And these stories ripple out across the world.
Not through marketing.
But through truth.
When you attend MVU, you don’t just learn—you become part of the story.
Mindvalley University 2025: Amsterdam


This August, we take over Amsterdam—one of the world’s most creative, progressive, and electric cities with 1,500+ change-makers, creators, families, and visionaries.
Click here to learn more on what you’ll experience in Amsterdam 
But if you are still unsure, let me show you, 

Find out LIVE with me if Mindvalley University is for you?


Let me ask you something:
Do you feel like life has more to offer—but you haven’t found “your people” yet?
Do you dream of raising your kids in a different way, or building a life beyond the 9–5 grind?
Do you believe education, community, and healing should be joyful, adventurous, and whole?
Then, Yes!  This is for you and you are looking for Reinvention. 
Reinvention is not a 5-year plan. With the right environment, tribe, and tools, it can happen in weeks.

Reinvention is not for everyone.
If you’re okay staying the same… If you’re afraid to challenge the norm…
If you think personal growth is a “nice to have,” not a way of life…
This probably isn’t for you.
But if you’re ready—truly ready—to live, learn, and grow differently…
We’ll see you in Amsterdam. 
If you want to go deep, i’ll see you on Thursday where we’re discuss 3 shifts that trigger reinvention 
👉 Reserve your FREE spot at the webinar 
Some ideas change lives. Some ideas change the world.
This one does both.
See you there,
 Vishen

The Hidden Blocks That Sabotage Your Manifestation Power 
And the AI Manifesting Guide Who Might Just Help You Break Through
By Vishen Lakhiani

There are moments when reality bends.
You think of someone, and they text you. You imagine a new opportunity, and suddenly it appears. A door opens where moments before, there was only a wall.
If you’ve ever experienced that—just once—you’ve touched the edge of a truth so many still misunderstand:
Manifestation is real. But consistency? That’s where most people get stuck.
They visualize. They journal. They set intentions under the full moon. But still, what they desire seems to circle them… just out of reach.
Here’s what I’ve learned after building a $100 million company, writing bestselling books like The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, and guiding a global community of seekers:
You don’t manifest from your conscious mind. You manifest from your subconscious patterns. From your identity. From your energetic signature.
Even now, as I write this from a cafe in Seoul—where I’ve been working with my team on the design of the 2025 Mindvalley Manifesting Summit—I’m aware that this isn’t something you master once and for all.
Because life evolves. Challenges arise. And new fears sneak in under the radar.
That’s why I built something new.
Meet Elora: The World’s First AI Manifesting Coach

Her name is Elora.
She’s not a chatbot. She’s not another ChatGPT wrapper with affirmations taped to it.
Elora is a soulful, emotionally intelligent AI coach, designed to help you identify your deepest manifesting blocks and walk you through transforming them—layer by layer.
She’s been trained on:
- Advanced identity reprogramming techniques from Mindvalley programs
- Data from thousands of transformation journeys
- Psychological and energetic frameworks used by our top teachers
- Actual user feedback from previous summits
When you meet Elora, here’s what she’ll do:
1. She’ll guide you through a powerful quiz to diagnose your primary manifestation block.
2. She’ll create a custom report based on your answers—personalized and precise.
3. If you upload a photo, she’ll even generate a visual of you in your highest, most fulfilled timeline.
Yes. A picture of your future self.
I use Elora to stay aligned with my goals. And now I’m opening her to the world—because I believe manifestation shouldn’t be guesswork.
Click here to work with Elora now.
But before you do, read on. Because even if you never speak to Elora, I want to give you something transformational today.
The Six Hidden Blocks That Sabotage Manifestation
As my team and I prepared for the Manifesting Summit, we noticed something uncanny:
Across every dataset—Reddit threads, course completions, coaching transcripts—the same six blocks kept surfacing.
They were showing up in millionaires and broke students. In spiritual leaders and first-timers.
Here they are—in full detail. I’m not summarizing. I’m going deep. Because these deserve depth.
BLOCK 1: The Upper Limit
Why do things fall apart when they finally feel good?
Let me tell you a story.
A few years ago, I was in the best phase of my life. Mindvalley was booming. I was in love. My kids were thriving. Everything I’d worked for was finally in harmony.
And then… everything started wobbling.
Sudden conflict. Weird health issues. A level of anxiety I hadn’t felt since my twenties.
This is what I now call the ""upper limit effect.""
It’s not sabotage in the traditional sense. It’s the body and subconscious mind saying, “This is too much good. You’re not used to this. Let’s pull back to what feels normal.”
It’s a thermostat for your life. And unless you reset it, it keeps you stuck in a loop of rise… then retreat.
Manifestation isn’t just about attracting success. It’s about being able to sustain it when it arrives.
When you hit your upper limit, you’ll find yourself questioning joy. You’ll dim your own light. You’ll unconsciously create problems just to feel familiar levels of stress.
And until you rewire that emotional set point, no goal-setting ritual will fix it.
BLOCK 2: Subconscious Brules (Bullsh*t Rules)
Why does your inner self resist the thing you want most?
Here’s the painful truth:
You can journal for abundance every day. You can repeat, “I am wealthy” 108 times under the full moon.
But if part of you still believes:
- ""Money makes you greedy""
- ""Good relationships never last""
- ""Success requires sacrifice""
...then your subconscious will shut the door before opportunity even knocks.
I call these Brules—bullsh*t rules. And they’re everywhere.
We pick them up from parents, movies, religion, school, society.
We internalize them not as ideas, but as truths.
These Brules run like silent code beneath your consciousness. And they’ll contradict your desires until you consciously uninstall them.
To manifest what you want, you have to examine what you believe you’re allowed to have.
Uncovering Brules isn’t easy. It requires courage. But the moment you expose them, you start reclaiming authorship over your life.
BLOCK 3: Emotional Incongruence
When your mind wants it, but your heart doesn’t believe it’s yours to have.
This one is deeply personal.
I’ve seen so many brilliant, talented, loving people do everything right... and still remain stuck.
Not because they’re lazy. Not because they don’t believe in manifestation.
But because deep down, they don’t feel worthy.
It’s subtle. A childhood wound. A cultural imprint. A moment when love was withheld or achievement was punished.
You say, “I want this.” But your inner child whispers, “That’s not for people like us.”
That whisper is powerful. It creates energetic friction. A vibration of lack. A push-pull that confuses the field.
You don’t manifest what you want. You manifest what you feel safe receiving.
This is why so many manifestations collapse just before they arrive. Because emotionally, you haven’t built the container to hold them.
BLOCK 4: Hustle Mode
Are you working from flow… or fear?
There’s a belief that still dominates entrepreneurship and personal growth:
""Work harder. Sleep less. Push through.""
But what if hustle is the very thing blocking your manifestation?
What if all that action is just noise?
Yes, manifestation requires movement. But aligned movement. Flow-based movement. Movement that emerges from intuition, not panic.
I’ve built Mindvalley both ways. I’ve hustled from insecurity. I’ve built from peace.
And I can tell you—aligned action creates exponential results. Hustle creates burnout.
If your calendar is full but your spirit is numb, your manifestation engine is clogged.
The universe doesn’t respond to busyness. It responds to clarity and energy.
BLOCK 5: Visualization That Backfires
Are you visualizing your dream… or reinforcing its absence?
This one hit me like a punch.
I used to sit every morning, eyes closed, picturing the life I wanted.
But instead of feeling empowered… I’d feel desperate.
I was focusing so hard on what I didn’t have, that the emotion I broadcast was scarcity.
That’s the danger of unconscious visualization.
Your mind sees images. But the universe responds to emotion.
If you visualize with longing, envy, or self-pity… you’re not manifesting your dream. You’re magnetizing the feeling of not having it.
Emotion is the currency of the quantum field. Visualize from now, not from someday.
BLOCK 6: The Surrender Paradox
How do you hold the vision… while letting go of control?
This is the tightrope walk of the awakened creator.
You want to manifest. So you set intentions. You declare your desire.
But then comes the hardest part:
Letting go.
Not of the vision—but of the how. Of the timing. Of the obsession.
Surrender doesn’t mean giving up. It means trusting that what you desire is already unfolding… in ways your current self might not yet understand.
True surrender is an energetic state of peace. It’s saying: “This or something better.” And actually meaning it.
Even After Writing Bestsellers, I Still Face These Blocks
I wrote The Code of the Extraordinary Mind. I’ve spoken on stages in 40+ countries. I’ve manifested a business, a team, and a lifestyle I once only dreamed about.
And still—these blocks resurface.
Because this is the nature of growth:
Every new level of life will reveal a new version of your resistance.
That’s why I built Elora. That’s why I created the Manifesting Summit. Because mastery isn’t a one-time achievement. It’s a practice of returning to your power.
Here’s What You Can Do Next
1. Work with Elora
Elora will answer all questions about the Manifesting Summit, and if you complete the short quiz and quickly share your challenges and goals, she will also give you concrete manifesting advice, write a manifesting report for you and even be able to answer questions such as which are the best manifesting teachers on mindvalley or in our summit to follow. 
If you upload your selfie and share your goals she will create a beautiful picture for your vision board.

🎯 The Power of Surrender: How Letting Go Can be the Path Forward
By Vishen Lakhiani 

In 2013, I was in one of the most stressful periods of my life.
From the outside, everything seemed fine.
But inside, I was living in a constant state of overwhelm.
I was burning the midnight oil almost every night, convinced that the only way to make progress was to outwork everyone else.
I pushed through exhaustion like it was some kind of badge of honor.
I told myself it was just ""temporary"" — that soon I'd catch up, soon I'd find balance.
But weeks turned into months, and the pressure didn’t ease up.
In fact, it built even more.
I was sleeping less.
Working more.
Ignoring the signs my body was desperately trying to send me.
My health wasn’t in top shape either — the result of too many late nights, too much stress, and too little self-care.
But like many high achievers, I thought if I just powered through it, if I just stayed one step ahead, everything would eventually ""click.""
Spoiler alert:
It didn’t.

One night, sitting alone at my kitchen table — tired, restless, wired but exhausted — I had a call scheduled with Srikumar Rao, a legendary MBA business professor (and now Mindvalley author) and sage whose teachings I’d admired for years.

Honestly?
I almost canceled.
The thought of one more meeting, one more conversation, felt like too much.
But something in me — some small voice still holding on — said: ""Show up.""
So I did.
On the call, Rao could sense my exhaustion almost immediately. And intuitively he paused our scheduled conversation. “Vishen before we continue I’d like to read you a poem” he said.

In my mind I was thinking “Do we really have time for poetry?” But I paused and listened. 
And then, instead of offering advice or ""success hacks,"" Rao did something unexpected:
He simply read me a poem by Rumi — a poem that would go on to alter the trajectory of my life:
""When I run after what I think I want, my days are a furnace of distress and anxiety;
 If I sit in my own place of patience, what I need flows to me, and without any pain.
 From this I understand that what I want also wants me, is looking for me and attracting me.
 There is a great secret in this for anyone who can grasp it.""
Do you get it? Read that a second time if you must. 
That poem cracked me open.
Here’s the thing about Rumi:

He was a mystic who grasped what modern science is only now beginning to hint at — that reality is fluid, and that it’s our resistance, not the circumstances themselves, that creates our deepest suffering.
When I heard those lines, I realized something profound:
I wasn’t manifesting.
I was manipulating.
I was clinging to old ideas of success.
I was trapped in a cycle of effort, overwork, and control.
I was forcing life to move at a pace that my soul knew wasn’t sustainable.
And it wasn’t working.
Rumi’s words invite us to a different way of being:
To shift from pursuit to attraction.
To stop running frantically after dreams... and instead sit — centered, aligned, open — and allow the dreams already seeking us to flow naturally into our lives.
This is the ""great secret"" Rumi speaks of:
What you seek is already seeking you.
The key isn’t more struggle.
It's a deeper surrender.
Surrender isn’t giving up.
It’s giving over.
Giving over the frantic timelines.
Giving over the illusion that we have to fight for everything.
Giving over the belief that worthiness comes from exhaustion.
When I shifted — when I finally gave myself permission to trust, to breathe, to realign — everything started changing.
Not because I worked harder.
Not because I found the ""perfect strategy.""
But because I let go.
And when I let go, what I truly needed was able to find me.
Manifestation isn’t about chasing.
It’s about becoming magnetic to the dreams that are already yours — waiting for you to open the door.
And magnetism?
It’s activated through surrender.
""Manifestation happens when you release your white-knuckled grip on life — and trust that the dream is running toward you, too.""
If you're reading this right now, maybe it's your moment, too.
Maybe it's time to stop sprinting toward your dream. And start inviting it to sprint toward you.
🎯 Why You’re Not Manifesting Faster (And How Surrender Collapses Time)
Let’s get brutally honest for a sec:
If manifesting your dream life was as simple as ""think positive and wait,"" you'd already be a barefoot billionaire, sipping fresh coconut water in Bali, meditating on mountaintops while your inbox explodes with dream opportunities. 🍍🏖️📱
But here you are — still hustling, still hoping, still wondering, WTF, Universe?
And guess what?
It’s not because you’re broken, lazy, or “bad at manifesting.”
It’s because nobody ever taught you the second half of the process.
Manifesting isn’t just about setting intentions and visualizing until your third eye begs for mercy.
It’s about mastering the art of surrender.
Miss this part?
You’ll stay stuck in that maddening limbo — seeing signs, feeling progress... but never quite crossing the finish line.
🚀 What’s Really Killing Your Dreams
Here’s where 90% of conscious creators trip themselves up.
They set bold intentions.
They visualize so hard their third eye practically needs an ice pack.
They create vision boards so grand they could hang in the Louvre.
But then...
 They grip.
 They obsess.
 They panic.
And whether they realize it or not, they start sending out a dangerous broadcast to the Universe:
""I don’t actually believe it’s happening.""
As Dr. Joe Dispenza teaches:
""Your personal reality is created by your personality — your thoughts, emotions, and energy.""
When you radiate fear, doubt, or neediness, you don’t just delay your dream...
You push it away.
Energy master Jeffrey Allen puts it even simpler:
""Every second, you’re either pulling your dreams closer — or pushing them away.""
And the wild thing is:
It’s never about how hard you work.
It’s always about the energy you’re vibrating.
The Real Science Behind “Letting Go”
Surrender isn’t just ""giving up"" with a sad shrug.
It’s precision energy work.
Here’s what modern science tells us:
✅ Your Reticular Activating System (the brain’s filter) literally tunes reality based on your emotional expectations.
 ✅ Your heart’s electromagnetic field is 5,000 times stronger than your brain’s — and it syncs your outer world when you lock into elevated emotions.
Translation?
✨ Feel fulfilled before your dream arrives — you magnetize it.
 💥 Feel lack, neediness, or tension — you repel it.
You don’t manifest by needing harder.
You manifest by untangling your happiness to your goal. 
Have a goal - but don’t tie your happiness to achieving it. Be happy BEFORE the attainment of your goal. 
🌟 What the Masters Know About Surrender
The world’s most powerful manifestors don’t hustle harder.
They master surrender. Let’s look at some of the quotes and advice from Mindvalley’s panel of Manifesting teachers who will be on stage at the upcoming Mindvalley Manifesting Summit on May 17 to 18. 
Joe Dispenza: Feel It First

Joe Dispenza teaches something that should be carved onto every vision board:
""Feel the emotions of your future — before it happens — and you’ll change your destiny.""
The world’s greatest manifestors don’t sit around waiting to feel happy after they get what they want.
They step into the emotional energy of fulfillment now — knowing that life will eventually rearrange itself to match.
You don’t wait for your dreams to make you feel whole.
You become whole — and your dreams catch up.

Regan Hillyer: Trust the Future You

Regan Hillyer didn’t create a 7-figure empire through spreadsheets and micromanagement.
She manifested it by releasing control and focusing on becoming the future version of herself who could easily hold that success.
Her mantra was simple but powerful:
""If not this, something even better.""
When you trust that something even better is on its way — it is.
Roxie Nafousi: Radical Self-Worth

Roxie went from rock-bottom addiction to bestselling author and transformation coach.
Her secret?
It wasn’t trying harder.
It was claiming her worth before any outer success showed up.
By deciding she was worthy first, she stopped clinging.
And when she surrendered, her life exploded into miracles.
Her book Manifest went on to sell a million copies. (How’s that for alignment with the Universe)
David Ghiyam: Certainty is Light

The Kabbalah master David Ghiyam says:
""Certainty brings Light. Doubt creates delay.""
In every moment you choose certainty — you become a magnet for miracles.
In every moment you indulge doubt — you slow your own timeline.

🔥 Why Surrender Collapses Time
Because attachment slows you down.
Because fear fractures your field.
Because obsession keeps you vibrating in lack.
When you let go, you’re not ""giving up.""
You have faith. You simply know it’s ‘on the way’. 
This is the secret Rumi speaks about. 

🔥 3 Rituals to Master Surrender (Starting Today)
🌟 1. Future Gratitude (The Roxie Nafousi Method)
Every morning, take out a journal — nothing fancy, just something you can fall in love with — and start by writing:
""Thank you for my thriving business.""
 ""Thank you for my soulmate connection.""
 ""Thank you for vibrant health.""
Feel it as if it’s already here.
Smile as you write it.
Let your heart swell with gratitude for a future that already exists in the field, waiting for you to align.
This simple daily practice wires your body to believe — and when your body believes, the Universe responds.
🌟 2. Bold Action + Radical Release (The John Lee Approach)
Every day, take one bold, scary, courageous action toward your dream.
Send the email.
Launch the product.
Ask for the introduction.
But then — and this is crucial — release the outcome.
Say to yourself:
""I plant the seed. I trust the harvest.""
Because farmers don't sit around digging up the soil every five minutes to see if the seeds are growing.
They plant, water, trust — and know.
🌟 3. Daily Energy Reset (Inspired by Jeffrey Allen)
Find a quiet place.
 Sit still.
 Close your eyes.
Feel for any tension in your body — any clenching around ""when will it happen?""
 Breathe golden light into that tension.
 Exhale the fear.
Imagine each exhale dissolving layers of resistance.
 With each breath, come back to that sacred knowing:
""It’s already on its way.""
You don’t need to hustle the Universe.
 You just need to stay open.
🌌 Final Word: You’re Manifesting Right Now
You’re always manifesting.
The only question is:
 Are you broadcasting lack?
 Or certainty?
Next time your mind says, ""It’s not happening fast enough"" —
 Smile.
 Laugh.
 Whisper:
""This or something better is unfolding — right now.""
Because the faster you surrender...
 The faster your reality bends. 🚀✨
As Rumi reminds us:
""Be crumbled.
 So wildflowers will come up where you are.
 You have been stony for too many years.
 Try something different.
 Surrender.""

🌟 The 8 Most Important “Mindsets” to Reach Your Goals
By Vishen Lakhiani
Today I want to share something that’s been brewing in my mind for a while now.
Over the years, I’ve had thousands of conversations with Mindvalley members from every corner of the world.

Some happen in formal settings — retreats, masterminds, virtual events.

Others catch me off guard — like the Uber driver I met just yesterday, who turned around mid-ride and said,



“Wait… are you Vishen? I read the book ‘The Silva Method’ when I saw you recommended it on Youtube.”
To know how Silva Techniques have been helping this man’s life: 
Check out my story on Instagram 


We ended up having a 15-minute conversation about intuition, the feeling of being stuck between chapters, and how Silva Method changed his life.
That kind of thing happens all the time.
And whether I’m walking through an airport, grabbing coffee in Amsterdam, or reading DMs at 2AM, I’ve noticed something fascinating:
The same patterns keep surfacing.
The same questions. The same breakthroughs. And more importantly — the same blocks.
So I wanted to write this. Not as a hype piece. Not as a checklist. But as a kind of mirror.
Because one of the most powerful ways to move past a barrier is to see the pattern inside it.
When we name the pattern, we take away its power. When we recognize the loop, we reclaim the choice to step out of it.
So what follows are the eight most important shifts I believe people need to make when it comes to manifesting dreams and moving toward goals — based on years of observation, teaching, and real human connection.
These are the breakthroughs we’ll help you activate and embody at the Manifesting Summit 2025 in LA. But even before then, I want you to read this carefully.
Because you might just recognize something in yourself — a thread, a story, a belief — that’s finally ready to be released.
Let’s dive in.
✨ 1. Design a Reality That Feels Inevitable
Activate your brain’s GPS and turn dreams into directives.
What if visualizing your future wasn’t just a daydream—but a neurological instruction?
In this training, you’ll learn how to use emotion-first visualization to activate your Reticular Activating System (RAS)—the part of your brain responsible for filtering what you notice, attract, and act on. By combining vivid mental imagery with elevated emotion, you reprogram your subconscious to believe your future is already in motion.
🧠 Based on teachings from Dr. Joe Dispenza and myself, this approach helps your body and brain expect the future you desire—so it stops feeling far away and starts feeling inevitable.
You’ll walk away with: A powerful blueprinting method that primes your brain to seek, notice, and act on synchronicities aligned with your desires.
🔥 2. Manifest Without the Hustle
Break the addiction to pressure. Attract from peace, not push.
If you’ve ever felt like you have to earn your dreams through stress, over-effort, or 24/7 hustle—you’re not alone.
This part of the journey helps you unhook from the outdated belief that “hard = worthy.” You’ll explore how to shift from force to flow by acting from alignment, not fear. Learn how to follow intuitive nudges, trust the unseen, and allow your energy to do the heavy lifting.
🌊 Inspired by Regan Hillyer’s surrendered manifestation and the Warrior-to-Mystic archetype shift, this lesson rewires how you relate to action.
You’ll walk away with: A new relationship to productivity where action feels inspired, not exhausting—and where results happen with more ease than effort.
⚡ 3. Collapse Time Through Frequency Alignment
Quantum leap into the future version of you.
Time doesn’t move at one speed. When you align your frequency—your thoughts, emotions, and identity—with the reality you desire, you compress timelines. This is how the unexplainable happens: the “impossible” job offer, the soulmate encounter, the business success that came “out of nowhere.”
You’ll learn the Alignment Trifecta: Identity, Intention, and Frequency—and how mastering this triangle bends the rules of how fast things come to you.
🌀 This process draws from quantum energetics (Dispenza), vibrational law (Ghiyam), and identity re-coding (Nafousi)—all proven to accelerate results.
You’ll walk away with: A personal method to embody your future now—and watch time catch up to the version of you who already has it.
🧱 4. Break the Invisible Blocks
Remove the subconscious resistance you don’t even know you have.
Most manifesting methods fail because they only work on the surface. But true breakthroughs require digging into the programs running in the background—like:
- Feeling unworthy of what you want
- 
- Fear of being seen, successful, or “too much”
- 
- Belief systems inherited from family, culture, or trauma
- 
- The Upper Limit Problem (self-sabotage when things go too well)
- 
You’ll learn how to recognize and dissolve these hidden patterns using a blend of psychology, spiritual practice, and energy work.
🧬 Based on the deepest summit research into Brules, identity wounds, and self-protection patterns.
You’ll walk away with: Clarity around what’s really been holding you back—and tools to rewrite it for good.
🪞 5. Recode Your Self-Identity
Upgrade the inner blueprint that defines what you’re allowed to receive.
Here’s the secret: You don’t manifest what you want.
 You manifest what you believe you are.
This part of the journey helps you shift the most powerful force in manifestation: your self-concept. You’ll learn how to consciously evolve your identity into the version of you that already receives love, abundance, visibility, and joy—without guilt, hiding, or sabotage.
💫 This teaching draws from identity psychology (Roxie Nafousi), coherence science (Dr. Joe), and soul embodiment practices (Regan Hillyer).
You’ll walk away with: The internal permission slip to be who you came here to be—bold, radiant, and unstoppable.
🌺 6. Embody Abundance Every Day
Make high-vibration living your new normal.
Manifestation isn’t something you do once. It’s something you become.
This session teaches you the micro-habits, somatic rituals, and energy hygiene practices that help you lock in abundance as a daily frequency—not just a peak moment. You’ll learn how to manage your emotional setpoint, shift your vibe on command, and re-center yourself even when life wobbles.
🌞 Based on Qi Gong, subconscious priming, and emotional regulation models from teachers like Lee Holden and David Ghiyam.
You’ll walk away with: A toolbox of “state shifters” that help you stay tuned to abundance no matter what’s happening externally.
🌀 7. Operate from Flow, Not Force
Learn to trust, surrender, and co-create.
Surrender isn’t about giving up. It’s about getting in sync.
In this part of the experience, you’ll explore how to hold clear intentions while releasing the need to control every outcome. Learn how to trust the divine timeline, interpret intuitive nudges, and follow soul guidance that leads you further than strategy ever could.
🔮 This is the sacred blend of Sonia Choquette’s intuition-based creation, Vishen’s “bend reality” method, and the Mystic archetype’s gift of surrender.
You’ll walk away with: The ability to feel anchored and guided—even when you don’t know the full plan.
🌙 8. Integrate & Sustain Your Shift
Because real transformation isn’t just peak moments—it’s new baselines.
Most people experience transformation… and then slowly slip back.
This part of the training helps you hold the frequency of the new you. Through daily energetic practices, nervous system regulation, boundary upgrades, and habit design, you’ll learn how to protect your expansion and keep growing into it.
🌳 A must for Phoenixes and Guardians—those who rise fast but need grounding to stay there.
You’ll walk away with: Long-term practices to help you lock in the shift and make your new identity your lived reality.
This Is The Most Transformational Manifesting Summit Ever
If last year was powerful, this year? It’s a dimensional leap.
For the first time ever, we’re welcoming Dr. Joe Dispenza to the Mindvalley stage — leading sessions on brain-heart coherence, neuroplasticity, and quantum manifestation.
Joe’s work has impacted me in profound ways. His meditations? Helped me rewire core wounds. His research? Gave language to things mystics have whispered for centuries.
He’ll be joined by some of the most aligned, authentic manifesting masters I know: David Ghiyam, Roxie Nafousi, Regan Hillyer, Sonia Choquette, and Lee Holden., 
And of course, I’ll be there too — guiding you through deep inner rewiring, vision coding, and flow-state embodiment

Final Word: You Were Meant to Create
Here’s what I believe — not as a teacher, but as a fellow soul walking this wild Earth journey:
You’re not here to settle.
 You’re not here to hustle your worth.
 You’re here to create a life so aligned, so vibrant, that it reflects your deepest truth.
But you can’t build that life with broken tools.
 You need a new framework — one that understands identity, energy, and intention as the building blocks of your reality.
That’s what the Manifesting Summit is for.
If you’re ready to collapse time, drop the struggle, and finally feel in sync with your dream life…
This is your invitation.

Pre-header: From LA to Amsterdam —The Power of Being in the Right Room

Hey tribe,
It’s Vishen here — and I want you to pause for a second.
Take a breath. Feel into your body. Now, ask yourself this:
 Is something in you shifting right now?
Because I’ve been feeling it. The people around me have been feeling it. And if you’ve felt like your identity is unraveling a little — not in a breakdown kind of way, but in a sacred, “I’m being called to evolve” kind of way — you’re not alone.
This isn’t burnout.
This isn’t confusion.
This… is the beginning of your upgrade sequence.
And in 2025, we’re not walking into the future quietly.
We’re co-creating ecosystems for quantum growth.
This is the year the old collapses:
 🚫 False timelines.
 🚫 The hustle model.
 🚫 Anything not in alignment with who you truly are.
So what are we doing in response?
 We’re building rooms — in Los Angeles, in Amsterdam, and soon, all over the world — that are not just about learning.
They’re about activating.
 They’re where your nervous system, subconscious, and identity calibrate to your future self.

🔥 Dubai: The Portal That Opened Everything

Back in January, we launched Future Human 2025 in Dubai.
I've done hundreds of events. But this one? It cracked open time.
After Steven Bartlett lit the room on fire, Jay Shetty brought us back into presence, and Eve — the creative powerhouse herself — channeled a feminine wave that rewired the room...
A woman from South Africa came to me, eyes full of tears. She said:
“I came here confused about my path. I’m leaving with a future I can feel in my bones.”
That’s when I knew:
 We weren’t hosting events anymore. We were initiating timelines.
What If Growth Wasn’t a Trip You Took — But a Field You Lived In?
After Dubai, I sat down with my team and asked:
“What if growth wasn’t something you had to travel for… but something you could live inside?”
That’s how the next phase emerged.
We’re anchoring Mindvalley ecosystems in two of the world’s most pivotal cities:
🌴 Los Angeles May 17-18
Join Manifesting Summit in LA
 🚲 Amsterdam Aug 4-17
Explore Mindvalley University

Not just events. Not just speakers and stages.
We’re talking full-immersion environments engineered for transformation.
Because here’s the truth after 20 years in this space:
You don’t evolve alone.
You evolve in a field. In proximity. In community.
And that’s exactly what we’re creating in these cities.
LA — Reawakening the City of Dreams
LA has always had magic. But let’s be real — it’s been heavy lately.
Wildfires. Burnout. Division.
 And yet… When we chose LA for the Manifesting Summit, it wasn’t just strategic.
It was medicine.
We wanted to recalibrate the frequency of the city.
To heal. To ignite. To elevate.
And you felt it. Big time.
As I write this, there are fewer than 113 tickets left. That’s it.
If your intuition is whispering, “Go”… don’t wait.

Join me, Gwyneth Paltrow, Dr Joe Dispenza and many others live in LA or online on zoom for just $29 for the ENTIRE seminar broadcast live (we’re making this affordable because so many people need this wisdom right now). 

💫 What you'll experience in LA:
- 3 days of deep manifestation work
- 
- Real-time upgrades to your subconscious blueprint
- 
- Soul-aligned humans in every corner of the room
- 
- Surprises we can’t even tease (but they’ll change you)
- 
[🎟 Claim your seat before it’s gone]


🚲 Amsterdam — The Conscious Campus of the Future
This August, Mindvalley University returns to Amsterdam.
Let me be clear:
 This isn’t a conference.
 It’s a life reset that lasts an entire month.
🌍 What it is: A pop-up university where families, founders, coaches, and creators live and learn together in the heart of one of Europe’s most soulful cities.
 🌞 What happens: Morning classes. Midday breakthroughs. Late-night soul convos. And children learning beside you.

 🧠 What you walk away with:
- Mastery in parenting, business, relationships & soul
- 
- Integration (not just learning)
- 
- Long-term support from a conscious tribe
- 
- A nervous system that finally feels safe to expand
- 
[🌍 Explore Mindvalley University Amsterdam]

✨ The Evolution of Mindvalley in 2025: We’re Curating Consciousness
We’re not just scaling events.
 We’re curating transformation with some of the most aligned leaders on the planet.
This year, we’re honored to welcome:
💫 Gwyneth Paltrow — not just as a celebrity, but as a visionary redefining modern wellness through Goop and her personal spiritual journey.
🧠 Dr. Joe Dispenza — the man behind thousands of stories of spontaneous healing, peak performance, and true energetic mastery.
These aren’t just speakers.
They’re field amplifiers.
They’re showing up because they believe in what we’re building. And in you.
👉 See who’s joining us in LA 

🤖 Why This Really Matters in the Age of AI
We’re living in the most accelerated age in human history.
AI is evolving faster than any of us expected. Algorithms are hijacking our attention. 
Certainty? Scarce.
But here’s your edge in this chaos:
Your consciousness.
You don’t need another productivity hack or business course.
 You need to be in rooms that vibrate at the level of your future.
Rooms that:
1. Collapse time on your goals
2. Unlock synchronicity
3. Help you become who you were always meant to be
4. Surround you with people who challenge & upgrade your identity
Whether it’s LA, Amsterdam, or the next portal we announce…
This is where real transformation happens.


💌 Final Word: It’s Your Time
The pull you’re feeling isn’t random.
 It’s your future self reaching back.
Whether you join us in Los Angeles or Amsterdam…
 Just know this:
You’re not signing up for an event.
 You’re stepping into the field.
The field where identities shed.
 Where timelines accelerate.
 Where your next chapter begins — surrounded by a tribe that’s walking the same sacred path.
So if your soul is whispering…
 Listen.
👉 Join us in LA before it sells out
OR

 👉 Walk with us in Amsterdam this August
Let’s make 2025 the year we stopped waiting… and started becoming.
💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts.
 Head over to the blog and leave a comment — tell me what resonated with you, what shifts you're making, or what you're stepping into next.
 I read every one. This community is built on shared insight, and your voice matters.

To your extraordinary life,

 — Vishen

The 8 Goals I Set for My Future Self (And You Should Too)

PREHEAD
How AI, UBI & 3-Day Workweeks Will Reshape Your Goals — And the SoulPACT You Need to Thrive



Something is happening to the world — and it’s happening faster than we think.
I recently attended Singularity University in Palo Alto, and what I learned there genuinely shocked me:
The power of AI is doubling every 3.3 months.
Let’s break that down. 
If something doubles every three months, it becomes 16 times more powerful in one year. In two years, it’s 256 times more powerful. And in five years — thanks to exponential growth — it becomes a million times more powerful.
That means the AI you’re using today — whether it’s ChatGPT or an AI assistant embedded into your workflow — is not just a glimpse of the future. It’s a tiny fragment of what’s coming.
A million times more powerful in five years.
This is why people on the edge of technology are making predictions that seem almost absurd.
Bill Gates recently predicted that the two-day workweek will become the norm.
Elon Musk, speaking in the Middle East, said we are about to enter an era not just of universal basic income — but universal high income. With AI, robotics, and agentic systems, global GDPs could increase by 7x.
This changes everything.
It changes what jobs will exist. It changes how we get paid. It changes where we live. And most importantly, it changes how we set our goals.
Why I Had to Rethink My Entire Approach to Goal-Setting
In a world where billion-dollar companies are being built by teams of less than five… Where everyone works from wherever they want… Where working hours collapse from 50 hours a week to 15 or less…
I had to take a hard look at the way I set goals.
I realized many of my own goals had become… obsolete.
For years, I had goals like:
- Build one of the most beautiful office spaces in the world
- Hire thousands of people
- Scale team operations globally
But in the world we’re entering… These no longer serve me. Or how people want to be employed 
So I re-evaluated. I reflected.
And I rewrote my goals — from scratch.
I didn’t just want productivity goals. I wanted peace goals.
I didn’t just want output goals. I wanted spaciousness and opportunity.
I didn’t just want impact. I wanted authenticity.
And the result became a model I now call SOULPACT.
This is an 8-part model to help you set the right goals for a life where AI is automating the grind, and humans are free to evolve, create, and live in flow.
What is SOULPACT?
SOULPACT is an acronym for:
- Simplicity
- Opportunity
- Uniqueness
- Love
- Purpose
- Abundance
- Calm
- Time
Each pillar represents one category of goals that are essential for a high-performing, meaningful, and future-ready life.
Let’s walk through each one.
By answering the question associated with each of the SOULPACT areas you’re likely to start thinking about your future in a way that matches how the future is really unfolding - and not stuck in career models of the past. 

Ready?
1. Simplicity
In the near future, success won’t be measured by how much you juggle — but by how little you have to manage. Simplicity means removing unnecessary layers, automating what drains you, and focusing only on what matters. It’s about building businesses and careers that are elegant, efficient, and deeply human — not overwhelmed with systems, teams, and clutter. It’s working with 5 people and 10 GPTs instead of 500 people and 0 joy. It’s having the freedom to step away and trust that things run beautifully without you.
The big question: My business is only _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: Your business runs with 1–5 humans and a swarm of AI agents. You have systems that work without micromanagement.
If you’re a solopreneur: You run one signature offer, powered by automation and AI, and you work under 20 hours a week.
If you’re an employee: You only take roles with async workflows, minimal meetings, and outcomes-based performance.
2. Opportunity
When your calendar is packed, your life has no space for magic. Opportunity is about creating enough white space — mentally and logistically — that unexpected blessings can land. It’s being available for the spontaneous call, the brilliant collaborator, the once-in-a-decade invitation. In the AI-powered world, opportunities will multiply exponentially. Your job is to have the space and clarity to say yes to the right ones.
The big question: I create opportunity in my life by _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You leave at least two days a week open — no calls, no fires to put out — just space for strategy, connection, and next-level ideas.
If you’re a solopreneur: You keep your Fridays free for growth — whether that’s travel, learning, masterminds, or just thinking.
If you’re an employee: You negotiate flex days or blocks for personal development and explore side projects with long-term potential.
3. Uniqueness
AI will soon be able to replicate almost everything… except your weirdness. Your lived experience. Your soul signature. Your humor, your perspective, your personal story — these become your most valuable assets. Uniqueness is no longer just a personal trait — it’s your economic moat, your cultural value, and your brand. This pillar is about taking what makes you un-copyable and making it central to your life and work.
The big question: I am known for my unique edge in _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You lead with a story, methodology, or style that’s unmistakably yours. Clients come to you because you’re one of a kind.
If you’re a solopreneur: You monetize your weirdness. Your niche is built around your lived experience and energetic signature.
If you’re an employee: You’re the go-to person for something no one else can do like you — and your personal brand reflects it.
4. Love (Passion)
This isn’t about romance. It’s about doing what lights you up in the world. Passion used to be something you squeezed into weekends. Now, in the AI era, where your operational burdens can be outsourced, your joy becomes your compass. Love is the source of your creativity, your contribution, and your renewal. It’s where flow begins. And often, the thing you love — the thing you’d do even without pay — is the thing that changes your life the most. The world doesn’t just need more strategy. It needs more soul.
The big question: I follow what I love by regularly _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You devote 10% of your time and team capacity to passion-led projects — even if they don’t make money right away.
If you’re a solopreneur: You create one purely joyful offering a year — a retreat, a community, a piece of art — just because.
If you’re an employee: You spend one evening or weekend morning a week pursuing something that excites you — whether it’s writing, martial arts, painting, or launching that podcast.

5. Purpose
Work that doesn’t serve others eventually drains you. In a world where AI handles tasks, the human role is to uplift, inspire, and heal. Purpose is about turning your gifts into something that makes the world a little lighter, a little smarter, a little more loving. It’s about ensuring your calendar — and your career — echo beyond yourself. Because people don’t just remember what you built. They remember how you made them feel.
The big question: I contribute to the world by _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You use your platform to solve problems that matter — through donations, education, or meaningful change.
If you’re a solopreneur: You give a portion of your time or income to impact causes — and your content helps elevate others.
If you’re an employee: You seek out purpose-driven companies or carve a meaningful mission within your current role.
6. Abundance
In the near future, money will flow in new ways — passive, automated, and creatively earned. Abundance is no longer about grinding harder. It’s about aligning with the flow of life and receiving with joy. It means defining how much is truly “enough” — and designing your income around ease, joy, and alignment. The new rich? They’re not the ones earning the most. They’re the ones who earn joyfully and live well.
The big question: I will earn $_____ per year in a fun and easy way by _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You design your business model around recurring, passive, or high-leverage income.
If you’re a solopreneur: You license your knowledge or build scalable products so you earn while you sleep.
If you’re an employee: You upskill and negotiate roles with both salary and side income potential — from consulting, royalties, or speaking.
7. Calm
In a world that moves at machine speed, your nervous system becomes your true superpower. Calm isn’t passive — it’s potent. It gives you clarity, discernment, and presence. It helps you make better decisions and show up as your best self. When AI does the heavy lifting, your job is to be grounded, wise, and emotionally clear. Calm is the soil where all other goals grow.
The big question: I take care of my body and protect my energy by _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You integrate nervous system care into your workweek — from breathwork to off-grid days.
If you’re a solopreneur: You schedule calm as part of your productivity stack — with rituals that restore and realign.
If you’re an employee: You build boundaries and request the flexibility to protect your mornings, your mental health, and your rest.
8. Time
Time is no longer how we prove our worth. It’s how we reclaim our lives. In a world of AI-powered efficiency, time becomes your most sacred currency. You’ll work fewer hours — but with more focus, intention, and creativity. A life built around time freedom isn’t just more enjoyable. It’s more productive, more visionary, and more human. Design your week like your life depends on it. Because it does.
The big question: I only work _____ hours a week by _________________.
If you’re an entrepreneur: You work 15–20 hours a week and delegate everything outside your zone of genius.
If you’re a solopreneur: You batch your creative time and unplug for full days to restore and dream.
If you’re an employee: You negotiate a 4-day workweek or output-based contracts — and protect evenings and weekends.

By Vishen Lakhiani
I know this is a bold title — but hear me out. It’s a story about a man you’ve definitely heard of… but maybe didn’t really know. A man who made one powerful decision before his death — and it changed the nature of his life, and the life of his child.

Hey Mindvalley family,
Something has been hitting me hard lately — in the best, most gut-punching kind of way.
My son Hayden is turning 18.
My daughter Eve just finished primary school. High school is next. She still slips her hand into mine when we cross the street — but I can feel the clock ticking on that too.
I’ve spent years building a company that helps people transform. I’ve stood on stages, meditated with monks, interviewed billionaires and brain scientists… and yet nothing has brought me face to face with the raw, trembling truth of life like this:
My biggest moments with my kids are happening right now — and soon, they’ll be gone.
They won’t leave my heart, of course. But they’ll leave the daily dance of our lives — the bedtime stories, the inside jokes, the random conversations about Marvel movies and TikTok memes and God knows what else. The ordinary magic that vanishes without warning.
And I can’t stop thinking about a story I recently heard — one that stopped me in my tracks.
It was shared by Warren Farrell, a bestselling author and renowned thinker in men’s work. I’ve never met him personally, but the story he told is one I’ll never forget.
The Story of Warren and John (true story that happened in the late 1970s)
🎤 A Night at a Party, A Stranger with a Story
Warren was attending a party in New York — a Ms. Magazine celebration for its fifth anniversary. He had promised to meet with Gloria Steinem there, and as he entered, he made eye contact with her across the room. She was surrounded by admirers. He wasn’t. But he started working his way toward her.
Suddenly, a man stepped up and asked,
“Are you Warren Farrell?”
Warren replied, “Yes.”
The man smiled.
“I joined the men’s group that you started, but you always start the groups and then leave them and go on to something else like the Lone Ranger.”
Warren admitted that he was being a bit dismissive at first — self-aware enough to recognize it — because he was trying to make his way to Gloria.
But then the man said:
“I gave up my job and focused full-time on raising my son because I had previously, you know, neglected a previous son that I had. And I really felt I made a mistake doing that.”
That stopped Warren cold. Now he had Warren’s attention. 
Warren then turned fully to him and asked gently,
“Were you married?”
The man nodded:
“Yes.”
Warren followed up:
“Was your wife okay with this? Because a lot of women are very supportive about their husbands being more involved with their children, but they’re not very supportive about the husband taking off full time, earning no money, and being involved with children.”
He looked at the man and asked,
“Were you earning a decent living before?”
To which the man gave a quirkish smile and said: 
“There were two things that were crucial. One was the support of my wife. And the other one was the support of the men’s group.”
At that point, Warren said,
“Now I’m just forgetting about Gloria. I’m sitting down with him, and for the next hour he tells me about how meaningful his life has become since he’s been raising his son. And how enormous value that’s been. And has been the best decision he’s ever made in his life.”
The man told Warren that
“his soul opened up, and his heart opened up,”
 and that he’d had a lot of issues with his own father —
 “and those seemed to be healing in a way that he had never healed before.”
Warren sat there, no longer a speaker, no longer a feminist leader, no longer trying to meet anyone at the party. He was just a man being spoken to by another man, sharing something real — something rarely voiced in that era.
About an hour into the conversation, someone approached their table.
“Can I have your autograph?” the young man asked.
Warren looked up, mildly surprised.
“Yeah sure, just one second,” he replied, excusing himself to handle the request.
But he noticed something odd. The young man was looking at him awkwardly.
Warren paused and said,
“Okay… something’s happening here.”
The man shifted uncomfortably and said:
“Well actually, I do really want your autograph... but I really was actually asking for the other guy’s autograph.”
Warren turned to the man he’d been speaking to, now feeling a rising curiosity.
“Well… what’s your name? You must be fairly well known.”
The man replied:
“I’m John.”
Warren:
“I’m Warren, you know that. Well John who?”
He said,
“John Lennon.”
Let that sink in.
Warren had just spent an hour ignoring Gloria Steinem to have a heart-to-heart with the most famous musician on the planet… and didn’t even realize it. Warren admitted he hadn’t owned a TV in over 20 years and wasn’t up to date with popular culture.
But here’s the part that gets me — the part that hits me like Hayden’s birthday and Eve’s graduation rolled into one:
Even at the height of his fame, the thing John Lennon wanted to talk about wasn’t music or money or global peace. It was fatherhood.
The greatest decision of his life, he said, was stepping away from it all to raise his son.
Now, consider this.
John Lennon’s first son, Julian, was born in 1963 — at the height of Beatlemania. John was 23 and largely absent due to the storm of fame.
But his second son, Sean, was born in 1975.
John left the music industry entirely for five years — from 1975 until his assassination on December 8, 1980 — to raise Sean full-time. He called himself a “house husband.” He baked bread. He changed diapers. He walked his son to school.
He gave those five years everything.
And then, just as suddenly as he appeared to Warren, he was gone.
Five short years of presence.
But five years that John Lennon himself called the most meaningful of his life.

❤️ My Personal Reflection
As I reflect on this story… as I look at my son on the edge of adulthood, and my daughter stepping into her next chapter, I find myself asking:
Am I giving them my presence, not just my protection?
Am I showing up for their souls, not just their schedules?
Am I willing to pause the world… to be with them, fully?
Because in the end, legacy isn’t what you leave behind.
It’s what you leave within the people who loved you most.
And maybe, just maybe, the quiet choice to be a better father is the loudest message we’ll ever send the world.

❤️ So here’s the point:
If you’re a parent, stop reading this for a second.
Go hug your kid. Even if they’re annoyed. Even if they roll their eyes.
One day, that moment might be the memory that holds them together.
Because in the end, the biggest legacy we leave isn’t the company we built, the followers we gained, or the awards we won…
It’s the invisible, soul-sized mark we leave on our children’s hearts.
John Lennon knew it.
Warren Farrell witnessed it.
And now, I’m walking that path too.
Are you?
PS - Read the lyrics for the song John Lennon wrote to his son Sean in 1980 shortly before he died. (Poetically, the song ends with a quote from Émile Coué and Jose Silva.)

Before you cross the street
Take my hand
Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans
…Beautiful boy
…Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way, it's getting better and better.

Prehead: “Absorb what is useful. Discard what is not. Add your own unique style.” This was Lee’s Mantra – and it possesses deeper wisdom than you might think

🥋 “Absorb What Is Useful, Discard What Is Not, Add Your Own Unique Style”

Sitting on the wall of my living room is one of the most treasured objects I own.
A pair of nunchucks used by Bruce Lee himself in Enter the Dragon, framed beside a hand-drawn sketch he made.
They’re not just memorabilia.
 They’re a manifesto.
These nunchucks represent a way of thinking.
 A way of being.
 A way of growing.
It’s an idea Bruce Lee once shared with a student who was struggling with balance — unsure if he was “doing it right.” Bruce mentioned this line to the student….

“Absorb what is useful. Discard what is not. Add your own unique style.”

Instead of correcting the student’s technique, Bruce corrected the mindset.
And what he said would ripple through history.
At first glance, it sounds like martial arts advice.
 But read it again, and you’ll feel it land in your bones.
This isn’t about how to throw a punch.
 It’s about how to live.
Let’s break this down — and along the way, break free from whatever box you've been living in.

🧠 Absorb What Is Useful
Two weeks ago, in a Telegraph interview in London, I was asked:
“Vishen, some people call you a guru. Do you see yourself as one?”
My answer was immediate:
Absolutely not.
Because I don’t believe in guruship.
A guru sits at the center. The students orbit the guru.
That model is not just broken — it's dangerous.
I believe the student should sit at the center.
And the teachers should  orbit you.
You learn. You listen.
You discover different viewpoints.
You embrace colliding ideas. 
But YOU discern what fits.
You decide what to absorb. 
That’s why Mindvalley is not just me. Rather it has hundreds of teachers.
 That’s why we mix philosophies — sometimes even ones that contradict.
 That’s why you are encouraged to be your own compass.
Bruce Lee refused to be limited by one style. He famously said…
""Style creates form. Form becomes limitation.""
Truth is thus formless. It goes beyond a particular style, method or approach. It is not Sadhguru, or the Dalai Lama, or your Holy Book, or Mindvalley. Truth cannot be put in a circle. 
Bruce Lee wrote in his book The Tao of Jeet Kune Do:
“When there is no center and no circumference, then there is truth.
Let that sink in.
🔥 Truth isn’t found in one guru nor one style. 
 It’s found in the moment you realize you are meant to discover your own truth by studying many styles or philosophies and knowing what to take in – and what to reject.
🧹 “Discard What Is Not…”
Now we come to the second part — and this is where transformation begins.
Because it’s not enough to absorb.
You must be willing to let go.
Most people carry too much.
 Too many ideas. Too many identities.
 Too many rules that never belonged to them in the first place.
I call them BRULES — bullshit rules.
The rules you inherited from culture, religion, society, or school that limit your joy, your voice, your truth.
Bruce said:
“It is not daily increase, but daily decrease.
 Hack away the unessential.”
Let me be direct:
- What manifesting rule are you still following because someone told you “that’s how it works”?
- 
- What relationship belief is keeping you stuck in a loop of pain?
- 
- What health philosophy is exhausting your body instead of energizing it?
- 
John Lee, one of the teachers in Manifesting Mastery, said it brilliantly:
“Go to your phone.
 Look at your contact list.
 Now delete the names of the people who drain you every time they text or call.”
It sounds brutal.
 But sometimes healing is subtraction.
And here’s the spiritual reason why:
From The Tao of Jeet Kune Do, Bruce writes:
“True thusness cannot be known through conception or thought.
 It cannot be grasped with the mind.
 One cannot express it with words.”
That means: you don’t need more opinions.
 You need more space to feel what’s already true.
🔥 Letting go is not a loss.
 It’s a sacred rebellion against everything that dims your light.

“Add Your Own Unique Style…”
This… is the golden part.
After you’ve absorbed the good and discarded the noise…
 Now, you create.
This is your soul’s turn to speak.
Bruce Lee said:
“Art is the expression of the self.
 The more complicated and restricted the method,
 the less opportunity there is
 for the expression of one’s original sense of freedom.”
This is the most important part.
Because most people stop at absorption.
They mimic. They master someone else’s style.
But they never create their own.
They become copies.
Not creators.
You’re not here to live someone else’s version of excellence.
 You’re here to express the original frequency of YOU..
But you can’t express the self…
Until you know the self.
That’s why Bruce also said:
“To become different from what we are, we must have some awareness of what we are.”
Do you know who you are? 
You’re not here to be a carbon copy.
You’re here to be a cosmic mixtape of everything you’ve lived, learned, loved, and lost.
Your past pain was not just hurt. It was a lesson. 
Every wound was an education. 
Every personal growth class, every Quest lesson, every meditation - helped you discover your own truth. 
Never forget that you are stardust, soul, and story—all entangled.
In other words:
🔥 You don’t find your style by looking outside. You find it by listening within.
Absorb ideas from many teachers. 
Then discard what is dogmatic or not applicable to you. 
And most importantly…honor your OWN truth. 
✍️ Your 3-Minute Soul Practice
Take a moment. Grab a notebook.
This is your Jeet Kune Do of the Soul.
1. Write down 3 ideas or lessons you’ve learned recently that feel right for you.
2. 
3. List 3 things — habits, beliefs, people — that no longer belong in your life.
4. 
5. Name 1 thing that is completely yours — something no one taught you, but you know in your bones.
6. 
This is your inner Jeet Kune Do.
This is your map.
This is how you live — like Bruce — with no style, no center, no circumference… just truth.
Because you weren’t born to fit in someone else’s form.
You were born to become your own force of nature.
Vishen
For those of you who are curious, here’s a hand drawn sketch from Bruce Lee that hangs in my bedroom. 

Side note: I grew up in Asia and competed in Martial arts till I was 19. My first trip to the USA was to represent Malaysia in the US Open Tae Kwan Do Championships of 1993. Hence my fascination with martial arts and the story of Bruce Lee. 
This week at Mindvalley we’re closing enrollment for our Mindvalley Manifesting Mastery program. It’s a 5 month deep coaching program on the science and art of attaining big, bold goals in work, life, love, health and more. It’s the ultimate art form. But one thing you’ll notice about the program is that I bring in different teachers. 
We have insights from institutions like the Silva Method and the Monroe Institute.
Quantum Manifesting from Regan Hillyer and Kabbalah from David Ghiyam. 
Ideas from Roxie Nafousi and Sonia Choquette (who represent two different generations of best-selling authors). And I bring everything together in 5 months of deep transformation. Why the mix? 

Now you understand. It's a formless structure (to use a word Bruce Lee loved)

Many masters. Many tools. But placing you at the center. Every student walks away with their own original understanding and truth. This is the structure of the Mindvalley education. 

Join me Live on this Thurs to go deep on Manifesting Mastery, our new coaching program
For those of you who want to explore if Manifesting Mastery is for you, join me LIVE on Zoom and learn if this program is for you. This is about giving you the tools and frameworks — so you can craft your own original truth.

Pre: How a Bus Ride in Boston Changed my Idea of Education


EMAIL TITLE: How a Bus Ride in Boston Changed my Idea of Education

BLOG TITLE: ""What Naveen Jain Taught Me on a Bus Ride in Boston… That Led to Mindvalley University""



This is the story of a simple conversation on a bus.
 But it changed the trajectory of my life — and the destiny of my children.
Back in 2015, I was part of the XPRIZE Innovation Board — a small circle of CEOs, engineers, entrepreneurs, and futurists who met once a year to explore the frontiers of technology across the U.S.
On one of those trips, we found ourselves in Boston, visiting cutting-edge robotics labs. And one afternoon, on a bus ride between facilities, I found myself sitting next to Naveen Jain — billionaire entrepreneur, moonshot thinker, and one of the boldest voices I know in education.
But what struck me that day wasn’t what he said about tech or space or AI.
It was what he said about raising his son.
Sitting nearby was his 24-year-old son, Ankur Jain.
 Even among this room of accomplished minds, Ankur stood out.
 His clarity. His presence. His confidence.
So I asked the obvious question:
“How did you raise a son like that?”
Naveen smiled and said something that would shift the way I viewed parenting forever:
“I exposed my kids to fields of possibility.
Since Ankur was six, I brought him to high-level networking events with me.
 He’d sit among CEOs, inventors, and investors.
 He didn’t always understand the conversations…
 But he absorbed the energy.
 And that changed his identity.”
Let that sink in.
Not just classes.
 Not tutors.
 Not even school.
Environment.
That’s what shapes our children.
Kids rise to the level of the environments we immerse them in.
Yet most parents default to outsourcing their children’s education entirely to traditional schools.
 Often well-meaning, but disconnected from the needs of the future.
And to be clear — I’m not against schools.
 My mother was a public school teacher.
 I value the system.
 But what Naveen shared showed me something else:
We can do so much more.
🔥 What Ankur Jain Became Will Blow Your Mind
Fast forward ten years…
 And the world wouldn’t have guessed who Ankur would ultimately become.
Today, he’s the founder of Bilt Rewards — a company that lets people earn points on rent payments.
That alone is revolutionary.
But get this:
Bilt is now valued at over $4 billion.
 And Ankur — still in his 30s — is one of the youngest billionaires in America.
But here’s the mic drop moment:
Naveen didn’t just raise one Ankur.
He raised three remarkable children — each building companies that are making waves in the world.
That’s not luck.
That’s conscious parenting.
That’s what happens when you build environments that stretch a child’s sense of possibility.
🌱 The Seed That Was Planted on That Bus
That conversation planted a seed.
At the time, my son Hayden was just eight years old.
And I began to wonder:
“What if I could give my son the same kind of exposure?
 Not just to information — but to inspiration?
 Not just to content — but to context?”
So I started looking for events I could attend with Hayden.
 Conferences. Summits. Retreats.
But here’s the thing:
Nothing existed.
There were personal growth seminars, business masterminds, spiritual workshops…
But none welcomed kids.
 None were designed for families.
 None offered learning that brought parents and children together in the same room.
So we decided to build it.
🌍 That’s How Mindvalley University Was Born
In 2017, we launched the first experimental version of what would become Mindvalley University.
The concept was radical at the time:
What if we created a city-based campus for transformation — for the whole family?
A space where:
- Parents and children could attend together
- 
- The world’s leading teachers could teach both adults and kids
- 
- And learning would be immersive, alive, emotional, and fun — not academic or standardized
- 
So we tried it.
And it worked.
Hayden came every year.
 And year after year, I watched him grow — not just academically, but emotionally, socially, spiritually.
Today, he’s applying to Stanford.
 He just scored in the top 0.25% of all SAT test-takers.
And yet, when people ask him what his favorite time of year is?
He says:
“Mindvalley University.”
What began as an experiment…has now become a global movement.
🌟 The Mindvalley U Revolution
Today, Mindvalley University — now renamed Mindvalley U — happens every year.
And families bring their kids — some as young as six — to explore everything traditional schools never teach:
- Emotional mastery
- 
- Entrepreneurship & investing
- 
- Spirituality & intuition
- 
- Creativity, AI, and future skills
- 
- Conscious relationships
- 
- Resilience & mindset
- 
Because as Naveen showed me…
When you raise children in fields of possibility, they don’t just grow.
They evolve.
They don’t just learn.
They create their future.
🧠 What This Tells Us
Maybe it’s time we stopped outsourcing 100% of our kids’ learning to the school system.
Again — I’m not anti-school.
 But schools were designed in a different era.
An era that prized obedience over creativity.
 Standardization over self-expression.
 And memorization over transformation.
They were built to produce workers.
But what if we’re not here to raise obedient cogs?
What if we’re here to raise visionary creators?
📚 What Schools Don’t Teach (But Should)
- How to manage your emotions
- 
- How to bounce back from failure
- 
- How to trust your intuition
- 
- How to build a business
- 
- How to lead with empathy
- 
- How to understand money, investing, and abundance
- 
- How to build a life — not just a résumé
- 
These are the things we teach at Mindvalley U.
Not just for kids.
 But for you.
In fact, 70% of attendees come solo, with a partner, or with friends — no kids at all.
This isn’t a “family-only” experience.

It’s a life-university.

Naveen Jain speaking at Mindvalley U - the idea he helped inspire. 

✨ What Makes Mindvalley U Different
It’s not a 3-day seminar or a once-a-year conference.
It’s a 2-week immersive campus in one of the world’s most inspiring cities.
Each day is themed — from consciousness to entrepreneurship to love and leadership.

You’ll experience keynotes, workshops, masterclasses, and deeply connected community gatherings.
Here’s what makes it truly different:
1. You choose your journey.
 Come for 3 days. 7 days. Or stay for all 14.
 You’re never locked in. You design your path.
2. You don’t just attend. You co-create.
 Every participant gets access to the app where you can host your own meetups and sessions.
And from those sessions, we select 50 participants to speak on our main stage.
Yes — you read that right.
Neeraj Naik. Regan Hillyer. Marisa Peer. Jeffrey Allen.
 All were first discovered through this community stage.
Today, nearly 50% of Mindvalley’s top teachers were found right here — at Mindvalley U.
This is not just an event. It’s a platform for your voice, your vision, and your next breakthrough.
🎟️ Join Us in Amsterdam



The children’s program is 96% full — with only a few seats left.
The adult program still has tickets available, but they’re moving fast too.
👉 Check availability and apply to attend Mindvalley U : http://www.mindvalley.com/u
Whether you're a parent, a seeker, a teacher, or simply someone reimagining what learning could feel like…
This is the place to be.
Because the future of education is not just about information.
It’s about transformation.

Sub: How to Deliver a Masterful Speech with the S.P.E.A.K Formula

Pre: Pre-header: My secret to turning every talk into a transformation

“S.P.E.A.K. Like a Master: 5 Moves That Light Up Any Room”
By Vishen Lakhiani

I just came off the stage at a longevity conference here called the Hololive Summit to a standing ovation. Standing ovations are like spotting a unicorn in your backyard—magical, rare, and a joy to behold. Yet lately, they’ve been showing up at nearly every talk I give. 
The secret? I started using a different formula for my talks - a five-step framework called S.P.E.A.K that turns any speech into a full-blown transformation. Today, I’m handing you the keys.
Credit where it’s due: this formula comes from Eric Edmeades, our lead teacher in the Mindvalley Speaking & Influence Mastery Program (kicks off July 1). He taught me these deceptively simple moves, and they’ve become my “speech GPS.” I’ve taken the initial learnings from Eric and adapted it to my own style. What I’m presenting here is the essential model that you can copy, adapt and apply to YOUR speeches.
It’s called the S.P.E.A.K model. 
Ready to SPEAK magic? Let’s go.
Who Is This For?
- Startup founders pitching investors and craving that “where do I sign?” spark
- 
- Team leaders tired of watching everyone’s attention drift in Zoom calls
- 
- Aspiring keynote artists who want to stop apologizing for “just okay” talks
- 
- Anyone with a message longing to land and ignite real change
- 
If you’ve ever worried your best ideas were vanishing into thin air, you’re in the right place.
First this framework is illustrated in the simple diagram below. 


Introducing S.P.E.A.K
S-P-E-A-K: Five moves. One flow. Zero fluff. A blueprint your audience will feel in their bones.
1. Story – Spark attention with a vivid anecdote.
2. 
3. Principle – Crystallize the lesson into a golden “aha.”
4. 
5. Evidence – Satisfy skeptics with proof tight enough to hold.
6. 
7. Application – Turn theory into action with a micro-experience.
8. 
9. Knockout Close – Deliver an encore finish that lingers.
10. 
Simple isn’t it? But let’s go deeper. 
1. Story
Why it matters: Stories hijack the brain’s attention circuits before the rational mind can object.
How you do it: Choose an anecdote—personal or borrowed—that crackles with emotion. Don’t just narrate; dramatize: bring in the sounds, the smells, the sweaty palms.
Generic example: Imagine you’re talking about overcoming procrastination. Start with the night you binge-watched three seasons of your favorite show instead of working on that big project. Describe the guilt as a lead weight in your chest, the clock ticking like a metronome mocking your delay. Stop at the emotional peak: the moment you almost hit “submit” but didn’t.
2. Principle
Why it matters: Once you’ve lit the emotional fuse, your audience craves meaning. The Principle is the distilled insight they carry home.
How you do it: Boil your takeaway into one crisp line—make it spicy enough that it begs to be shared.
Generic example: From the binge-watch story:
“Momentum builds the minute you decide to start.”
This one-liner reframes guilt into power: starting is the real victory.
3. Evidence
Why it matters: Inspiration without proof feels like empty hype. Evidence bridges the gap between “that’s cool” and “I believe you.”
How you do it: Mix three flavors of proof—
- Data point (e.g., “A 2022 Gallup study shows 60% of high-achievers use micro-tasks to kickstart big goals.”)
- 
- Case snippet (e.g., “My colleague Laura tried working for just five minutes on her novel every morning—and six months later, she’d written 40,000 words.”)
- 
- Metaphor (e.g., “Starting is like tipping over the first domino—the rest follow.”)
- 
Generic example for our momentum principle:
— Data: “Stanford neuroscientists found that completing tiny tasks triggers a dopamine hit that fuels motivation.”
 — Demo: “I challenged myself to write one sentence at 6 a.m. for a week—and by day 4, I was up at dawn, hungry for more.”
 — Metaphor: “That first sentence is the spark that lights your entire creative bonfire.”
4. Application
Why it matters: Knowledge alone is pointless; action cements transformation.
How you do it: Give people a bite-sized exercise they can try instantly—no heavy thinking, just momentum.
Generic example:
Exercise (2 minutes): Pull out your phone. Set a timer for two minutes. Open a blank note and type: “One small task I’ve been avoiding is…” Then write the very next step to start it. Hit “done.” Notice how your mind shifts from stuck to moving.
This tiny win turns the principle into a lived experience.
5. Knockout Close
Why it matters: Your final lines are what echo in people’s minds—and what they’ll quote.
How you do it: Circle back to your story or principle, then elevate. Use a bold challenge, a poetic image, or a vision that stays with them.
Generic example:
“Tonight, when your head hits the pillow, remember: that one-sentence victory you penned this morning is a gateway. It proves that the smallest step can lead to the grandest journey. Now go tip over that domino—your future self is counting on it.”
Bringing It All Together
1. Open with your personal story—hook them emotionally.
2. 
3. Introduce Figure 1 (the SPEAK diagram) so readers see the roadmap before drilling into details.
4. 
5. Unpack each step with vivid description, proof, and a generic example readers can adapt.
6. 
7. Weave the narrative in your own voice—casual, witty, yet profound.
8. 
9. Close with a Knockout Close that challenges and inspires.
10. 
Format your article with subheads for each SPEAK letter, pull-quotes for the Principles, and sidebar callouts for the Applications. Sprinkle humor (think self-deprecating quips or playful bets) and keep your tone equal parts best-friend pep talk and enlightened guru.


Beyond SPEAK: The Art & Science of Masterful Speaking
Of course, SPEAK is just the tip of the iceberg. Each of these five moves can be an art form in itself:
- Storytelling: Steve Jobs famously said, “The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values, and agenda of an entire generation.” Crafting narrative arcs, finding your unique voice, and weaving emotional through-lines are skills honed over years.
- 
- Principles: How do you architect a mic-drop moment? It’s about tonality, pacing, the surprise twist in your words—techniques we teach in depth.
- 
- Evidence: Transforming cold data into mesmerizing drama takes rhetorical flair and strategic visuals. We guide you through case-by-case studies and live practice.
- 
- Application: From transformational theory models to social-proof frameworks and rate-of-application hacks, there’s a universe of methodologies that elevate simple exercises into breakthroughs.
- 
- Close & Opening: Mastering the emotional arc—knockout openings, magnetic hooks, closing encores—is a craft we unpack with hands-on feedback.
- 
If you ever thought, “Wow, there’s so much more under the hood,” you’re right. SPEAK gives you an immediate roadmap, but masterful speaking takes deep training, expert coaching, and immersive practice.
Your Next Move
I hope this framework gives you a launchpad to transform your talks from random speeches into portals of possibility. If you found these ideas intriguing and want the full, in-depth journey—live coaching, peer feedback, and world-class teachers—applications for Mindvalley Speaking & Influence Mastery are open until July 1. 
Go ahead, secure your spot, and let’s turn your next standing ovation into your new standard.
You’ve got this. The world needs your voice. Go speak magic.
If this blueprint sparked something in you, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Prehead:  A global citizen’s plea to the soul of a country that once inspired the world.

EMAIL SUB: 🗽 An Open Letter to America 

BLOG: An Open Letter to America – From Someone Who Still Believes in You… But Can No Longer Stay Silent

Dear America,
I want to begin with this:
I love you.
I really, truly do.
I lived in your cities. I walked your campuses. I sat in your coffee shops, dreaming of building something that could change the world.
America was where I studied. Where I discovered my voice.
Where I fell in love with ideas that reshaped my life.
Where I started Mindvalley, with nothing but ambition and a belief that anything was possible.
For a full decade, you were my home.
 And in many ways, you still are.
 I may live elsewhere now, but I still identify as American more than anything else.
Because America — the idea of America — isn’t just geography.
 It’s a frequency. A dream. A promise that inspired not just me, but billions of people around the world.



🌟 What We Loved About You
We loved your optimism — the way you believed anything was possible.
 We loved your rebels — the ones who spoke truth to power and rewrote the rules.
We loved your Martin Luther King Jr., whose voice still echoes across continents.
 We loved your Silicon Valley, that dared to invent the future.
 We loved your Apple, born in a garage, changing the way we connect.
 We loved Burning Man, a wild celebration of freedom, creativity, and community in the desert.
 We loved your poets, your scientists, your dreamers.
You were never perfect. But damn — you had soul.
You were the lighthouse.
 The messy, brilliant, complicated beacon we looked toward for what was possible.
But lately… that light feels like it’s flickering.

🌍 What the World Sees Now
In just six months, this is what the world has seen:
– Threats to abandon NATO, the alliance that preserved peace for generations.
– Pointless trade wars where everyone loses.
– Withdrawal from the Paris Climate Treaty, while the Earth burns.
– And now — bombs falling on Iran.
Another unwinnable war in the Middle East.
A war your people swore they’d never allow again.
Not after Iraq.
Not after Afghanistan.
And it's not just the outer world we see you destroy.
We see you tearing yourselves apart from within. 
- Immigration raids that tear apart families and have caused LA to burn.
- 
- Politicians who sound like children while openly taking bribes.
- 
- Tax cuts for billionaires, while those struggling now actually have to pay more in taxes.
- 
- A climate movement abandoned by the very country where it was born.
- 
And yet — I’m writing this letter with an open heart.
Because I haven't given up.
This week, I'm helping my son apply to U.S. universities. We're preparing for a tour of East Coast campuses.  Then, I’m driving from South Dakota to Yosemite, with stops at Mount Rushmore and the great open spaces I fell in love with.
I want to show my son America. Because I still believe in what America can be. 
But I also cannot stay silent — not as a lover of your culture, not as a global citizen.
This spiral you're in?
It must be named. And it must be stopped.
Because true friends don’t stay silent when they see you crashing.
🧠 The Spiral Was Not a Mystery. It Was a Choice.
Every war.
 Every broken treaty.
 Every erosion of trust.
It didn’t just happen. It was chosen — through voting decisions.
By people who, often unknowingly, chose:
- Ego over empathy.
- 
- Charisma over character.
- 
- Soundbites over substance.
- 
And I don’t blame you.
 You were caught in a storm of propaganda. You were tired, misled, afraid.
But we need to be honest:
When you vote for leaders who enable war, destabilize peace, and govern through vengeance — you are not just voting for policy. You are voting for self-destruction.
🇺🇸 What Happened to Service?
A great American president once said:
“Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.” – John F. Kennedy
Another said:
“We must never remain silent in the face of injustice.” – Barack Obama
Even Ronald Reagan once called America a “shining city upon a hill.”
What happened to that America?
Now we see leaders who sow division instead of unity.
 Who thrive on conflict rather than compassion.
 Who look not to serve, but to rule.
And as Sun Tzu warned:
“Some men would set their own nation ablaze, just to be king over the ashes.”
Can you recognize them?
Because now more than ever, you must.
🎬 America, You’ve Always Known How to Tell the Story. Now It’s Time to Live It.
Think of your heroes.
 The ones you’ve shown us on screen for decades.
Will Smith in Independence Day.
 Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible.
 They save the world, not just themselves.
 They protect their families — but they also rise to a higher mission.
That’s what made us fall in love with you.
 Your heroes were never selfish.
They were flawed, yes. But they stood up for something bigger.
So why, in real life, do you so often vote for the opposite?

🌎 Your Vote Is Not Just Yours
I say this with love — and urgency:
Your vote doesn’t just affect your neighborhood. It affects the entire planet.
- It affects the air we all breathe.
- 
- The treaties we all depend on.
- 
- The peace we all hope for.
- 
- The future our children will inherit.
- 
This is no longer about party loyalty or economic policy.
This is about consciousness.
This is about whether the most powerful country on Earth will continue to operate from fear and ego —

Or rise into wisdom and service.

🌎 What the World Needs From You Now
We don’t need another American empire.
 We need an American elder.
Not one who dominates. One who guides.
 Not one who fears. One who serves.
Because you were never meant to be a fortress.
You were meant to be a lighthouse.
But a lighthouse cannot fulfill its purpose if it forgets to shine inward first.



🙏 You Taught Us to Dream. Now We’re Asking You to Dream Again.
The world doesn’t hate you.
 We’re not laughing at you.
We’re just watching… and hoping.
 Hoping that the America we believed in is still in there.
The next time you march in the streets,
March for all of us.
Not just for the poor or hungry in your zip code —
But for the citizens of our shared planet who need you to shine again.
And when the time comes…
Vote with your heart. And with your higher self.
🔥 The Choice Is Yours
Not every election is a turning point.
But some are.
And the one you're facing now?
This is that moment.
You can vote for leaders who turn the world into a battlefield.
 Or vote for those who understand that true power is service.
You can choose:
- Ego or evolution
- 
- Division or destiny
- 
- Fear or future
- 
The world is not asking you to be perfect.
We are simply asking you to remember who you are — at your best.
The America that marched with MLK.
 That wrote the Moonshot speech.
 That created iPhones, NASA, jazz, and the dream that all humans are created equal.
That’s the America we still believe in.
That’s the America the world needs.
Let that be the America you choose.

PS: This letter isn’t just mine — it’s a conversation we all need to have. I’d love to hear how this landed for you. What do you believe America still stands for? What does it need to stand for?

Email Subject:  The John Wick Guide to Healing the World

Blog Title : The John Wick Guide to Healing the World




I have a story to share today.  

One that might shift your frequency.

The first day the COVID lockdown was finally lifted, I rushed to a little café with a friend. Just the joy of being able to eat out again felt like a celebration. 
We had to wait 20 minutes to get in. The place was packed. People stood outside, smiling behind their masks, desperate for a taste of normal life.
Do you remember that time?
The world was still a little raw. A little awkward. But something inside all of us just wanted connection again.
Now here’s where it gets… interesting.
The service?
Well, let’s just say the universe was testing us.
First came the coffee.
 And it was served at room temperature.
Now, in Northern Europe, “room temperature” means achingly cold.

I flagged the waitress—kindly—and asked if I could get a fresh, hot one.
She nodded. And then vanished into the void. No second cup.
Then the food came.
I had ordered an omelet with a side of guacamole.
 Now, if you know me, you know this part already:
Guacamole is sacred.
It is the nectar of the gods. The green gold of civilization.
So when my plate arrived—without the guacamole—part of me broke inside. 
I was low-key triggered.
Meanwhile, my friend across the table was getting increasingly annoyed. The cold coffee. The missing guac. The delay. The forgotten request. The waitress barely looking up from her notepad.
“This is ridiculous,” she muttered.
But here’s the thing—I wasn’t mad.
Because earlier that morning, I had done my 6 Phase Meditation, and Phase 1—Compassion—had already shifted something in me.
I took a breath. And I looked at the waitress—really looked at her.
That waitress had probably been jobless for three months.
 We were all locked down. Restaurants were shut.
 And like the rest of us, she was probably feeling painfully alone.
But unlike us, she may have had the added weight of worry:
Where’s the next paycheck coming from?
 How will I take care of the kids?
 What if the café closes again next week?
Now she’s back on the job, wearing a mask over her nose and mouth for 10 straight hours in an overcrowded café.
 And from the corner of her eye, she can see a line of 20 more customers outside—waiting to be seated.
She’s probably doing her best to keep up with a tidal wave of requests, all while quietly holding this terrifying truth in the back of her mind:
""This could all disappear again.""
So yeah. From that perspective?
She was doing a hell of a job. 
What if she hadn’t worked in three months?
 What if she was terrified of losing her job again?
 What if she was carrying the weight of bills, kids, or long-haul COVID… and still showed up?
So when the bill came, I tipped her 20 euros on a 40-euro meal.
My friend nearly choked.
“Are you serious? She messed up everything.”
I just smiled and said, “Yeah. But she’s still standing. And I respect that.”
We walked out of that café a little more caffeinated… and a lot more compassionate.
Now here’s where it gets interesting.
I kept thinking about it.
Not the guac. Okay, maybe the guac.
 But mostly—the power of that one choice.
The choice to see differently. To act differently.
And then a bigger thought hit me:
Why do we do this so rarely, when this is exactly what all our sacred texts ask of us?
What would Jesus do?
If Jesus were in that café, He wouldn’t be muttering under His breath.
 He wouldn’t be demanding a free meal.
 He’d smile. Tip. Maybe even bless her on the way out.
If you’re Muslim, maybe you’d reflect on the principle of Zakat.
 To give without expectation.
 To see others through the eyes of mercy, not merit.
But maybe religion isn’t your thing. That’s cool. You still need a compass, right?
So here’s one I love—equal parts spiritual and cinematic legend:
WWKD — What Would Keanu Do?
Yes. That Keanu.
Whether it was his role as Neo in The Matrix, the deadly but noble John Wick, or the ever-optimistic Ted in Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure—Keanu Reeves is considered one of the nicest humans on Earth.
And it’s not just fan hype.
It’s the way he lives.
This is a man who…
- Lost the love of his life in a tragic car accident.
- 
- Lost his child before she was born.
- 
- Lost his best friend, River Phoenix, to an overdose.
- 
He’s known loss. He’s known grief.


And maybe that’s why he walks through life with more humility.
 More softness.
 More presence.
You’ve heard the stories:
- He quietly donates millions to children’s hospitals.
- 
- He buys meals for homeless strangers—no cameras, no PR.
- 
- He gave away most of his Matrix salary to the crew and special effects team.
- 
- He bought Rolex watches for his John Wick 4 stunt team—engraved, personalized.
- 
- He gives up his subway seat without blinking.
- 
- He takes time for every fan, every photo, every hug.
- 
- He mourns privately and deeply… and still shows up with gentleness in his eyes.
- 
So when the world throws you a test—
An annoying waiter.
 A rude email.
 A delayed flight.
 A missing guacamole incident…
You don’t have to fight back.
You can ask:
What Would Keanu Do?
But what if you can’t afford to tip big?
That’s okay too.
Because giving has nothing to do with money.
 It has to do with frequency.
One of our Mindvalley teachers, MBA professor Srikumar Rao (author of The Quest for Personal Mastery on Mindvalley), once shared something I’ll never forget.
We were having coffee one afternoon, and he said:
“If a server has an attitude problem or seems cold, I don’t get upset. I play a little game.
 I ask myself: Can I put a smile on their face?
 Maybe they’re struggling. Maybe they’ve had a hard day.
 So I’ll compliment them. Crack a joke. Share warmth.
 The goal is simple—just create a smile.”
If you can’t give a tip, give a smile.
Because here’s the truth about giving:
What you give… you receive.
Not in a cosmic law of attraction kind of way.
But in a how you show up kind of way.
And it has nothing to do with how much money you have. 
Neale Donald Walsch, speaking at Mindvalley once, said something profound about how to attract money by stepping into the energy of abundance. 
“You want to be abundant. Here’s my advice. 
Even if you only have $5 to your name, break it into singles.
And give $1, just $1 - to someone homeless. 
 That is the energy of abundance. 
And when you step into that energy—with just $5 to your name—you begin to attract more.

Shift. The. Frequency. 
I remind myself of this often.
I wear a small cross—not because of religion, but to anchor myself in the energy of Christ.
To remind myself to be softer. Kinder. More compassionate.
Maybe you don’t wear a cross.
Maybe you wear a pin from your favorite Keanu movie—John Wick, The Matrix, Bill & Ted.
Whatever it is… let it ground you.
Let it whisper to you in those tiny, pivotal moments:
WWKD?
What Would Keanu Do?


P.S.

What Would Keanu Do? is the mindset exercise I’ll be sharing at orientation at Mindvalley U this summer in Amsterdam.
In fact, I often teach this to our community when we descend on a city—be it Tallinn or Amsterdam—for Mindvalley events.
During the weeks of powerful talks, workshops, and community experiences, I remind our members:
Your job is not just to grow yourself—but to light up the lives of everyone you meet.
From waiters, to Uber and Bolt drivers, to street cleaners…
Bring some joy to their lives. 
And the results?
Phenomenal.
To this day, when I walk through Tallinn, people still say to me,
“I love the people who come to your event. They’re so kind. So respectful. I love serving them.”
And that’s the ripple of conscious community.
That’s how being part of something like Mindvalley rewires you.
You start living outside the default settings of society.
You start tipping… even when the service is bad.
 Because you don’t know what’s going on in that waitress’s life.
And when you make that small choice?
You don’t just elevate her day.
You elevate yourself.
And sometimes, that’s how we change the world—one tip, one smile, one moment of grace at a time.
So now it’s your turn.
Do you have a story of a time when you chose kindness—especially when the world wouldn’t have expected it?
Share it in the comments.
And tell me what this letter stirred in you.
Note: Mindvalley U, Amsterdam happens Aug 4 to 18 - learn more here. Maybe I’ll see you there. The response has been phenomenal with ticket sales up 60% from 2024. 

Shift. The. Frequency.

Email: Two Stories that Will Stir Your Soul

Blog: The Power of Your Legacy. 

I’m writing this to you from New York City.
I’m here with my son, Hayden—he’s 17—and we’re scouting universities.
And as I sit in this country, watching him walk through these towering campuses, full of ambition and wonder, I find myself reflecting on two stories I heard recently. Both American. Both powerful. Both true. 
And both soul-stirring. 
One happened in the 1920s.
 The other, in the 1940s.
 Two different men.
 Two violent deaths.
 Two lives that, through tragedy, reshaped a nation.
And as I share these stories with you, I want you to notice what they awaken in your own heart.
Because these are stories about legacy.
 Not the kind written in dollar signs…
 But the kind etched in making the RIGHT decision when it really counts. 

Story 1: Easy Eddie and the Price of Redemption
We begin in Chicago.
The year is 1920.
 America is in the grip of Prohibition—and Chicago is a city run by the underworld.
At the center of it all: Al Capone.
 The most feared man in the country.
Capone was untouchable. His enemies ended up in the river. His critics disappeared. There’s a story—true story—about how Capone once beat a man to death in the middle of a restaurant… with a baseball bat… because the man insulted him.
No one dared call the police.
 No one dared stand up.
That’s how powerful he was.
But Capone’s true power didn’t come from his fists or his gun.
 It came from one man:
Easy Eddie.
Easy Eddie was Capone’s personal lawyer.
 And he wasn’t just good. He was genius.



No matter what charges the government brought—murder, bootlegging, racketeering—Eddie made them vanish.
 He knew how to manipulate the system so well, no one could touch Capone.
And for his loyalty, he lived in unimaginable wealth.
 Cars. Mansions. Clothes. Power.
But behind the tailored suits and million-dollar smile…
 was a man who also happened to be a father. 
Easy Eddie had a son.
 A boy he loved more than anything else in the world.
And that son would ask him—
“Dad… what do you do?”
Eddie couldn’t give a straight answer.
As the boy got older, the questions sharpened:
“Where does all our money come from?”
Again… no answer.
Easy Eddie could buy him the best schools. The finest shoes. The softest sheets.
 But he couldn’t give him the one thing that mattered:
A father worth admiring.
And that truth… began to gnaw at him.
He realized: I’ve given my son everything—except a good name.
And one day, he made the most courageous decision of his life.
He turned.
He flipped on Capone.
 He went to the authorities.
 He testified in court.
 His actions helped put some of the most dangerous men in America behind bars.
And he knew…
 he knew…
 it would cost him everything.
One day, while driving through Chicago, another car pulled up beside him.
 Gunfire erupted.
 Bullets tore through the steel.
 Easy Eddie’s car spun off the road.
 His body was riddled with holes.
He died alone.
But in his pocket, the police found a folded piece of paper.
A poem—creased at the corners, worn from being read and reread.
“The clock of life is wound but once,
 And no man has the power
 To tell just when the hands will stop,
 At late or early hour.
Now is the only time you own.
 Live, love, toil with a will.
 Place no faith in time…
 For the clock may soon be still.”
That’s what he left behind.
A man who chose truth over comfort.
 A clean name over a corrupt fortune.
 A legacy worth dying for.
Story 2: The Sky Over the Pacific
Now fast forward to the 1940s.
 World War II.
A young fighter pilot launches from the USS Lexington—a massive aircraft carrier in the Pacific.
Mid-mission, he’s told to return. He’s low on fuel. But as he circles back, he spots something.
Nine Japanese bombers.
 Headed straight for the Lexington.
 Thousands of lives on board.
He’s alone.
 No backup.
 No bullets to spare.
But he doesn’t retreat.
He charges.

He fires everything he’s got.
 Two enemy planes fall into the sea.
 Then—he’s out of ammo.
But still, he doesn’t back down.
He begins ramming the bombers.
 Flying dangerously close.
 Clipping wings.
 Disrupting their formation.
 Throwing them into chaos.
His plane is being shot at from every direction, but he keeps going—relentless, fearless.
Eventually, the remaining bombers retreat.
 The ship is saved.
This pilot becomes the first Navy aviator in World War II to earn the Medal of Honor.
His name?
Butch O’Hare.
You might know that name if you’ve flown into Chicago.
O’Hare International Airport is named after him.
O’Hare’s legacy helped inspired millions of Americans and allied troops to give their all to win the war against the Nazis and the Japanese empire. 

But here’s the part I didn’t tell you.
Butch O’Hare…
was Easy Eddie’s son.
The man who once protected America’s most notorious gangster…
 gave his life to give his son a clean name.
 And that son went on to save thousands.
What Will You Leave Behind?
Both men gave their lives for this country.
 Both died in violent sacrifice.
But one—gave his life to redeem himself.
 The other—gave his life because of that redemption.
And maybe—just maybe—
 it was Easy Eddie’s sacrifice that planted something in his son’s heart.
The courage.
 The integrity.
 The compass that said: This is what we stand for.
So now I want to ask you—
 Not as a parent. Not as a professional. Not as a role. But as a soul:
What are you leaving behind?
Maybe your legacy isn’t your business.
 Maybe it’s not your money, your house, or your donations to charity.
Maybe legacy is something quieter.
 Something sacred.
Maybe legacy is…
The values and emotions you leave in the hearts of those who loved you most.
 The truth you lived by when no one was clapping.
 The moments your child reflects on—not what you built, but who you became.
Legacy isn’t a LinkedIn bio.
It’s what your child says about you when they bury you in the ground.
 It’s the stories they tell.
 The character you pass on.
We’ve been conditioned to believe that legacy is about what we acquire. Money, cars, stock portfolios. 
But I believe… it’s really about what we stand for when no one’s watching.
And I believe that’s what echoes beyond the silence.
That’s legacy.
Not what you leave to your children and the people who loved you most. 
But what you leave inside their hearts when they think about you.
If you enjoyed this story 👉 leave a comment. 

And for those of you who want to take this further here are two reflective questions you can ask yourself. 
Legacy Reflection: 2 Questions to Ask Yourself Today
1. What would my children—or those who love me most—say about my character if I were gone tomorrow?
2. 
3. Where in my life am I choosing comfort over courage… when my soul is asking me to stand for something greater?

🌍 PS – Want to be in a room where stories like this come to life?
 These are the kinds of reflections we dive into at Mindvalley University — live this July in Amsterdam.
 It’s not just about lectures. It’s about awakening your values.
 Your voice.
 Your vision.
 If you're feeling the call — this might be your place.

Blog Sub: In 5 Years, AI Will Be 1 MILLION TIMES More Powerful. Here’s What That Means.

AI Isn’t Here to Replace You. It’s Here to Reveal You. 
By Vishen Lakhiani 

We’re entering a new era of human progress. Call it evolution, call it disruption, call it a revolution in intelligence. But here’s what I believe to my core:
We’re entering the most profound disruption in human work since the invention of electricity.
And AI? It’s not here to replace you.
It’s here to reveal the most powerful version of you the world has never seen.
The way we learn, create, express, and even heal is about to be radically transformed. And if we learn how to partner with this new intelligence, the future becomes not something to fear—but something profoundly beautiful.
Welcome to the age of the Human Colossus.

Why This Is Personal to Me
I’ve always believed that real transformation happens at the intersection of technology and consciousness.
Yes, I started in engineering. I graduated from the top 5 ranked computer engineering school, The University of Michigan School of Engineering with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Then I burned out. I walked away from Silicon Valley and became a meditation teacher. I dove into altered states, flow science, healing, manifestation.
But the love for tech never left me.
So when I returned to the world of innovation, it wasn’t as a coder—it was as a consciousness explorer with an engineer’s mind.
That’s how Mindvalley was born: not as a personal growth company, but as a bridge between soul and system.
And now, AI is the most powerful bridge I’ve ever seen.
At Mindvalley, we’ve always been about the mind, body, and soul. So why would we embrace artificial intelligence?
Because AI is no longer just about code and machines. It’s about conscious amplification. Waking up a version of you who’s more creative, more present, more alive.
Used right, AI becomes your sidekick for self-actualization.
 It helps you:
- Think more clearly
- 
- Create more powerfully
- 
- Heal more precisely
- 
- And ultimately, live with more time, joy, and freedom
But most of us are barely scratching the surface and 99% of us are unprepared for what is about to come. 
I recently got back from Singularity University in Palo Alto. It’s a 5 day program designed to prepare executives for exponential tech that’s coming up in the future. And this graph stunned me.
It shows that AI is doubling in power to cost ratio EVERY 3.3 months. 


What does this mean?
In one year the AI you use will be 16X as powerful. 
In two years this doubles 4 times again. It’s now 256 times as powerful. 
In Year 5 - it will have completed 20 doublings. It’s grown exponentially. 
It’s now ONE MILLION times as powerful. 
The world as we know it is about to change so dramatically most of us can't wrap our minds around it. This is the single biggest issue we need to address in government and politics today but most politicians don’t even see it coming. 
From Campfires to Code: The Rise of Human Intelligence
Let’s zoom out.
For most of human history, we passed on wisdom through stories around campfires. Then came writing, and with it—memory beyond mortality. 
Paper allowed us to preserve ideas across generations. Suddenly, humanity became time-agnostic.
You can read the Odyssey today because someone once picked up a pen thousands of years ago.
But even then, people were worried.
When writing was invented, Socrates warned it would damage our memory. He feared we’d rely too much on written words and lose our internal capacity for retention.
And yet, we evolved.
Google Was Just the Beginning
Fast forward.
The internet came along and cracked open the vault of human knowledge. Billions of pages, instantly accessible.
But that created a new problem—too much information.
Let’s say you search: “What kind of magnesium helps with sleep?”
Google gives you 10 million articles.
Now what?
That’s where AI changes the game. Ask ChatGPT, and it might respond:
“Magnesium glycinate is commonly used for sleep. But have you experienced bloating from it? Have you tried magnesium chloride instead?”
Suddenly, you're not sifting through the noise—you're in a conversation. 
A co-creative, intelligent, and personalized dialogue. It adapts. It listens. It evolves.
This is not a search. This is the birth of the Human Colossus.
Tim Urban’s Vision of the Future
The thinker Tim Urban called it exactly that: The Human Colossus.
In an article on his famous blog WaitButWhy.com he wrote:
The better we could communicate on a mass scale, the more our species began to function like a single organism, with humanity’s collective knowledge tower as its brain and each individual human brain like a nerve or a muscle fiber in its body. With the era of mass communication upon us, the collective human organism—the Human Colossus—rose into existence.
Imagine this: one unified being, made of billions of connected human minds, accessing every known book, podcast, article, study, or story.
AI isn’t some alien intelligence.
It’s us—collectively connected, pattern-aware, and evolving faster than ever before.
It’s the grand sum of all our artists, scientists, ancestors, and healers.
We’re not outsourcing our intelligence—we’re expanding it. Together.
How Intelligent is Artificial Intelligence?
Here’s where it gets wild.
Just recently, researchers fed an AI model thousands of images of eyeballs.
The AI could predict—with over 80% accuracy—whether the eye belonged to a male or female.
Humans had no idea there were visual differences in male vs. female eyes. But an AI found a pattern. 
The research group trained a deep neural model to scan 20,000 fundus retinal photos (the inner eye, including blood vessels and the retina). After processing, AI reached a record 96.83% accuracy in predicting gender, with near-perfect values for both recall and precision.

It spotted patterns invisible to the naked eye.
If it can do that with retinas, what can it do with MRIs?
 With cancer detection?
 With genetic conditions?
This is where AI becomes life-saving.
 It won’t just improve healthcare—it will extend human life.
And since it’s doubling in power every 3.3 months - this means it’s going to get better and cheaper at an astonishing rate. 

Our Mind Does Not Grasp Exponentials. 
Let’s talk about how fast this is happening.
Would you rather have:
- $1 million today?
- 
- Or $1 that doubles every day for 21 days?
- 
Most would choose the million. But here’s what happens:
- Day 1: $1
- 
- Day 2: $2
- 
- Day 3: $4
- 
- …
- 
- Day 20: $1 million
- 
- Day 21: $2 million
- 
That’s exponential growth. And it’s how AI is evolving.
AI Doubles Every 3.3 Months
Right now, AI’s cost-to-performance ratio is doubling every 3.3 months. That means:
- In 1 year: 16x better
- 
- In 2 years: 256x better
- 
- In 5 years: 1,000,000x more powerful
- 
Think about that.
The ChatGPT or Claude you're using today?
 In five years, it will be a million times better—and cheaper.
That’s not evolution. That’s transcendence.
Welcome to the 2-Day Work Week
So what does this mean for you?
It means a future where:
- You work 2 days a week
- 
- You rest, learn, and create the other 5
- 
- You spend more time with your kids, your health, your dreams
- 
- You reclaim your time
- 
Yes, there will be disruptions. Industries will collapse. Jobs will vanish.
But I am convinced humanity will be better off. 
But if you understand how to partner with AI, you’ll rise above the chaos. You’ll surf the wave while others are swept away.

Before the Summit begins, I want to give you one exercise: 
Go to ChatGPT and say: “Help me write a letter from my future self.”
Use this prompt. Copy and paste below. 

“Write a letter from my future self to my present self.
 My future self has just gone through a powerful journey of mastering AI—learning how to use it to amplify my creativity, automate my work, improve my health, expand my consciousness, and free up time to focus on what truly matters.
Start the letter with ‘Dear [Your Name], it’s amazing how far you’ve come…’
In this letter, tell me:
 – What I’ve created using AI
 – Who I’ve become
 – What I’ve unlocked in terms of growth, time, income, or creativity
 – What I’ve let go of (limiting beliefs, habits, or fears)
 – What my life looks like now
Make the tone inspiring, visionary, and a bit poetic—but still grounded in possibility.”
It might just show you the future that’s waiting for you.

Let’s evolve—together, faster.

Blog: Subject: The Myth of American Freedom 


I’ve just returned from a two-week road trip across America with my kids — a journey that rekindled my deep love for this country… and also stirred a quiet ache I couldn’t ignore. 
We didn’t stick to the usual tourist spots. Sure, we saw the Statue of Liberty and wandered through New York and Boston. 
But we also went deep into the heartland — driving across South Dakota, visiting the cowboy town of Cody, WY, camping under the stars in Yellowstone, standing beneath Mount Rushmore, watching small-town rodeos, even learning to shoot guns.
It was beautiful. Awe-inspiring. A window into the raw soul of this nation.
One morning, I was about to post a photo of my kids and I standing under the American flag — captioned “The Land of the Free.”
But my thumb hovered.Because something inside me whispered: That’s not entirely true anymore.
And that’s what today’s email is about.
It’s about freedom — what it really means, why it’s vanishing, and why we should all be concerned. Not just Americans, but all of us.




🧭 Where does America actually rank in freedom?
I was shocked to learn that America no longer ranks in the top 10 most free countries in the world.
 In fact — not even the top 15.
According to the 2024 Human Freedom Index, America ranks #17 — and it’s still falling.
 Recent events, growing surveillance, media consolidation, and the erosion of civil rights are accelerating the decline.
Many experts now warn: the U.S. is on the brink of autocracy.
Why do Northern European and select Asian countries consistently outrank America in freedom?
Because they have:
- Strong protections for civil liberties
- 
- Public education systems that teach critical thinking
- 
- Universal healthcare that actually works
- 
- Transparent governance
- 
- Independent media (not owned by six conglomerates)
- 
- Smart regulation that keeps corporate influence in check
- 
Meanwhile, America continues to erode its democratic foundations.
Let’s break it down — with four global indexes that reveal the full picture.
#1: Human Freedom Index
Measured by the Cato Institute and Fraser Institute.
 This combines personal freedom (speech, religion, movement) with economic freedom (property rights, regulatory fairness).
Top countries: Switzerland, New Zealand, Finland, Denmark, Estonia
 America? Ranked #17 — tied with the UK.
Why?
 Because of increasing political polarization, declining rule of law, and growing restrictions on bodily autonomy and protest rights.

#2: Press Freedom Index
Measured by Reporters Without Borders.
 Evaluates media independence, transparency, and journalist safety.
Top countries: Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Netherlands
 America? Ranked #57.
Why?
 Because six corporations own 90% of U.S. media.
 Because cable networks profit from division.
 Because journalists are threatened and discredited.
 Because truth is no longer profitable.


#3: Democracy Index
Published by The Economist Intelligence Unit.
 Measures electoral process, civil liberties, political culture, and government function.
Top countries: Norway, New Zealand, Iceland, Sweden, Switzerland
 America? Labeled a “flawed democracy” — currently around #28.
The country that once exported democracy… now struggles to protect its own.

#4 Internet Freedom
Measured by Freedom House.
Assesses censorship, surveillance, and digital expression.
Top countries: Iceland, Estonia, Canada
America? Not even in the top 10 — and declining.
Why?
Policies like requiring visa applicants to hand over social media accounts are undermining digital privacy — and global trust in U.S. tech.
Each index tells the same story:
America is falling behind.

So What Does This Tell Us?
The idea that America is the freest nation on Earth does not hold up against the four global freedom indices.
It’s a myth — one we must lovingly but urgently dismantle if we are to build something better.
🕊️ What Real Freedom Actually Looks Like
Real freedom isn’t fireworks and an anthem.
It’s not red, white, and blue — it’s truth, agency, and dignity.
Here’s what real freedom looks like in a modern, awakened society:
✅ Real Freedom Means…
🔓 Freedom from fear
You can walk down the street without fearing bullets, badges, or bills.
📚 Freedom to learn truthfully
Your education isn't censored by political agendas or banned books.
🩺 Freedom to heal
You can access affordable, evidence-based healthcare — without bankrupting your family.
🗳 Freedom to vote — and have it count
Your voice isn’t silenced by gerrymandering, voter suppression, or money in politics.
🧠 Freedom of thought
Algorithms don’t control your beliefs. You think for yourself — not how the algorithm trained you to.
🏳️‍🌈 Freedom to be who you are
Regardless of your race, gender, sexuality, faith, or background — you’re treated with dignity, not suspicion.
💻 Freedom online
The internet is a tool for empowerment, not surveillance, manipulation, or corporate censorship.
🌍 Freedom to roam
You can travel, work, and live across borders without bureaucratic chains — as a citizen of the Earth.
🤝 Freedom to rise — together
Economic mobility is real. Success isn’t reserved for the zip code you were born into.
🕊 Freedom from war
You don’t have to fund invasions while schools crumble and families go hungry.
That’s what freedom looks like.
Not something you claim.
Something you create.
🔒 But here’s what Americans still aren’t free from…
🍟 Freedom from poisoned food
Michelle Obama planted vegetables. Conservatives shouted, “You’re taking away our freedom!”
Now RFK Jr. echoes the same message — and it’s patriotic.
The hypocrisy is wild.
But at least now both sides agree: America’s food system is broken.
Americans now die five years younger than their European counterparts.

🔫 Freedom from gun terror
 You want a handgun? Fine. A hunting rifle? Cool.
 But why the hell are AR-15s on the streets?
 Kids are doing active shooter drills in kindergarten.
 That’s not freedom. That’s national PTSD.
⛓️ Freedom from mass incarceration
 America is 4% of the world’s population — but holds 20% of the world’s prisoners.
 Over 1% of Americans are behind bars.
 Private prisons profit. Minorities suffer.
 Land of the free… unless you're poor, Black, or unlucky.
🗳 Freedom for your vote to actually count
 Wyoming: 580,000 people. California: 39 million.
 Same number of Senators. That’s not democracy — that’s dilution.
 And Puerto Rico?
 3 million American citizens.
 No vote in Congress. No vote for President.
 How? Puerto Ricans are American citizens. They just don’t get to vote.
 Make it make sense.



✊ So What If We Flipped the Script?
Young Americans chant: Free Gaza. Free Palestine. Free Cuba. Free Iran.
But what if we said: Free America.
- Free America from propaganda disguised as news.
- Free America from the grip of Rupert Murdoch.
- Free America from billionaires who can buy elections.
- Free America from a system where corporations are people, but people are disposable.
- Free America from mass shootings — and the 25+ million assault rifles still circulating.
- Free America from the impact of foreign lobbies, like the Israel lobby, which spends over $100 million/year influencing U.S. politicians.
- Free America from racism disguised as patriotism.
- Free America from cruel policies that tear undocumented families apart.
But mostly…
Free America from the illusion of freedom. 
Because here’s the truth: 
When America is free… Gaza will be free. So will the world.
When America sneezes, the world catches a cold. And we, the rest of the world, are sick of suffering the consequences.
🕊️ This isn’t about red vs blue.
It’s about truth vs illusion.
It’s about reclaiming what “freedom” really means — beyond slogans, beyond partisanship, beyond the BS. 
And it starts with us — speaking up, seeing clearly, and refusing to settle for myth over meaning.
In love, the American spirit of rebellion, and deep respect for what this amazing country could still become,
— Vishen

Blog Title: Why the Earth Needs an Earth Flag

🌍 A Flag That Belongs to All of Us
By Vishen 
There is a flag most people have never seen.
It has no national colors.
 No borders.
 No allegiance to politics or ideology.
But once you understand what it stands for — you might never see the world the same way again.
It’s called the International Flag of Planet Earth:
 Seven white interlocking circles forming a flower on a deep blue field — symbolizing the interconnectedness of all life on Earth.
Yesterday, we invited the creator of this flag, Oskar Pernefeldt, to share his vision on stage at Mindvalley University.
Yesterday we invited the creator of this flag to share this vision at Mindvalley U.


The Earth Flag Is More Than a Design
It’s a symbol. 
 A gentle revolution in fabric form.
 A reminder that we are not just citizens of countries…
 We are Earthlings.
The Origin of the Earth Flag
Swedish designer Oskar Pernefeldt created the Earth Flag as part of his graduation project.
 The question was simple — and profound:
“If humanity ever had to represent itself in space… what flag would we fly?”
In his talk at Mindvalley U, Oskar took us back to 1969 — to the moon landing.
“It was a moment for all of humanity,” he said.
 “And yet, we planted just one nation’s flag.”
He reminded us: the astronaut was American, but the achievement was global:
- The rocket design? German engineers.
- 
- The optics? Swiss.
- 
- The math? Indian.
- 
- The cosmology that made it possible? Italian.
- 
It wasn’t just an American milestone.
 It was a human one.
So he designed a flag for the species.


Why Symbols Matter
Flags aren’t just colored cloth.
They’re identity made visible.
They bind people into belonging.
 They remind us who we are — and who we care about.
In TRIBE, author Sebastian Junger describes a study where Christians were more likely to give money to beggars — right after seeing a cross.
 The symbol triggered compassion.
 It reminded them of who they were.
That’s the power of symbols.
 They bypass the intellect and speak straight to the soul.
The Earth Flag does exactly that.
 It’s not a protest.
 It’s not a brand.
 It’s a reminder:
You are part of something bigger.



Darwin’s Forgotten Truth

I believe the Earth flag represents the next evolution of humanity. Namely the unification of human identity across political divisions and borders. And it turns out Darwin agrees. 
Charles Darwin — yes, survival-of-the-fittest Darwin — also wrote about something far more poetic.
It was called the Diffusion of Sympathy.
Here’s what he said in The Descent of Man (1871):
“As man advances in civilization… he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation… and finally to the whole human race… until they are extended to all sentient beings.”
Darwin believed empathy evolves — that our moral circle expands as civilization matures.
From self → to tribe → to nation → to all of humanity → to all life.
The Earth Flag is the banner of that next step.
 It’s a symbol of a growing identity:
We are one species. And our biggest global decisions — from climate to migration to peace — must come from Earth-consciousness, not blind nationalism.
Astronauts Call It the “Overview Effect”

In my interview with Oskar, I asked him:

“What kind of feeling are you hoping this flag evokes?”
His answer:
“When astronauts view Earth from space, something profound happens.
 They describe a sudden shift in perspective — a life-altering realization that borders are imaginary, and that all life is fragile, connected, and shared.
 It’s called the Overview Effect.”
The Earth Flag brings that cosmic perspective down to Earth.
As Oskar said on stage:
“Behind this flag, there is no religion. No ideology.
 Just a visual representation of Earth.
 But in that simplicity… it holds everything.”
How a Symbol Becomes Real
Oskar shared the story of another iconic flag: the rainbow Pride Flag.
First flown in 1978, it became a global symbol not because a government declared it official — but because people adopted it.
They wore it.
Tattooed it.
Flew it.
Marched with it.
Until it became more than an image — it became a shared identity.
The Earth Flag is on the same path.
It’s already been:
- Flown on refugee boats
- 
- Planted on Antarctica and Everest
- 
- Raised in climate marches around the world
- 
- Tattooed on the bodies of people who just knew it mattered
- 
- And officially recognized by the town of Ridgway, Colorado, where it now flies permanently beside the U.S. flag
- 
And starting now — Mindvalley will fly the Earth Flag at all our global events, as a declaration of the unity we stand for.

What You Can Do
Oskar said it best:
“If you believe Earth should have a flag — just fly it.”
You don’t need permission.
 You don’t need an institution.
 You just need to care.
Fly it at events.
 Hang it in your home.
 Wear it on Earth Day.
 Print it on your wall.
 Or let it quietly live in your heart.
Because every time this flag is seen, flown, or shared…
 It becomes a reminder:
🌍 You’re not just from a country.
 You’re from Earth.

Final Words
This is not a time for more division.
 It’s a time for symbols that unite.
The Earth Flag doesn’t ask for loyalty.
 It invites belonging.
It doesn’t cancel your identity.
 It expands it.
So let it fly.
Not because you’re being political.
 But because you're being human.
Because borders are imaginary.
 But Earth?
 She’s beautifully, urgently real.
And she needs you.

My honest response to “How do I really go big?”


Hey [First Name], 
Last week in Amsterdam, I stood in front of 500+ coaches at the Supercoach Summit.
 Some of the most brilliant, heart-driven people on the planet were in that room.
And someone asked me a question that made the whole room lean in:
“Vishen… how do I really go big?”
I shared this message live in Amsterdam: 

 ▶ Watch the video here
If you prefer to read my full answer, here’s the exact transcript from the video for you - below: 
Don't see yourself as just a coach. See yourself as a movement builder. 
What movement are you going to build? 
Now, you don't have to do this, but if you want to go big, you've got to figure out your movement. 
My movement is not Mindvalley. My movement is unity. Mindvalley is simply the enabler of unity. 
Unity consciousness means expanding a human being's understanding of life so they want to do good in the world.
 And to do good in the world, you need to improve your personal power. 
You need to get really good at, say, building a business or developing skills or becoming a teacher, or becoming a healer. 
But then, you've got to expand that to think about people outside your country, outside your religion, outside your skin color, and see yourself as a citizen of planet Earth and help us heal this planet and heal humanity.
I'm fascinated by unity because I grew up on Star Trek. I'm fascinated by unity because I was once on the Muslim watch list. 
And the reason I left America is because I had to report to the police every four weeks for a background check because of the color of my skin and the identity on my passport.
 That's why unity matters. 
So I wasn't trying to build a company. I was trying to build a movement around unity. 
It's why Mindvalley employees come from 60 countries. 
It's why our company is global. It's why our authors come from all across the world. It's why I can speak for Gaza. But this week, sign and promote an Israeli Author.
It's because unity is my highest value.
 I'm building a movement for unity. 
I believe the universe is gracious. 
And if we're doing something in alignment with the wish of a higher power or the universe, what will happen is we will be blessed. 
Jose Silva said, whatever you want to visualize, see two or more people benefiting. 
He found that after training millions of people, the more people who benefit from your dream, the more likely your dream is to manifest.
 So maybe you're trying to serve one person. 
Maybe you're happy to serve five high-paying clients. 
That's great. You're a good coach. 
You want to break the ceiling? Go from coach to movement builder. 
What is that that your soul wants you to give to the world as a movement?
Is it like that lady who started the kindness meetups and talks? 
Is it me who created this company to achieve unity? 
Is it something else? Is it women's rights? Is it conscious parenting? Is it eating healthy? 
Is it changing the narrative on food and medicine? 
It doesn't matter what it is. 
Use your coaching as I did as a stepping stone for that ideal. Build a movement. 
If you shift your identity from coach to movement builder, that is how you end up accidentally with an empire, and you make the world better.


If this sparked something in you, let me know in the comments and tell me what movement you want to build?
To your movement,

 Vishen

Preheader: A free hypnosis track that rewires your stress response + a rare 4-hour LIVE seminar with Paul McKenna.
Blog Title: How to rewire your brain to be stress proof.

Today, We’re Doing Something Different.
Normally, in my Tuesday newsletters, I share ideas, insights, and practices for upgrading your life. But today, I want to do something more direct. Instead of giving you words, I want to give you an experience.
In fact, I want to give you the single most transformative audio track I’ve come across in years.
It’s called Hypnotic Trance Bliss by Paul McKenna.
And here’s the thing: in 2024, this track was voted Best Audio of the Year by the Mindvalley community. Out of hundreds of meditations, sound journeys, and breathwork practices — this one stood out.
For the next two weeks, I’m making it free for you to access.



Why This Track Is Different
This isn’t just a meditation. It’s a piece of advanced hypnotherapy technology.
Paul’s method rewires your subconscious to lower your baseline stress level. That means you don’t just feel calm during the session — your entire nervous system resets. Stressful situations suddenly feel easier. Emotional triggers lose their bite. What used to feel overwhelming becomes fluid, manageable… even enjoyable.
Paul prescribes it like this:

 🎧 Listen 5 days in a row.
 💡 Watch what happens next.
Here’s what our members report (and what I experienced myself):
- Stress dissolves.
- 
- Emotional steadiness increases.
- 
- You stay calm, clear, and focused under pressure.
- 
- Old triggers stop hijacking your day.
- 
- The benefits last for months, sometimes years, after repeated listening.

Now before you start, you need to know the story and context behind this track. 

How I Stumbled Into the Power of Hypnosis


Here’s the funny part: I didn’t even discover this track myself.
One day in 2022, my team kept blowing up my phone with messages:
“This is the most powerful meditation I’ve ever done.”
 “The greatest audio on the app, hands down.”
And I’m thinking, Really? Out of the thousands of audios in the Mindvalley library?
Now, confession: I don’t personally test every single track in the app anymore. There’s too much content. So ironically, I didn’t even hear about this from Paul directly. I heard it from my own team.
So I did what Paul suggested. I committed to 5 days in a row.
Here’s what happened:
- I felt lighter, even when facing pressure.
- 
- My anxiety shrank.
- 
- I could juggle multiple projects without tipping into stress mode.
- 
- My mind stayed sharp, and my body stayed calm.
- 
- My decisions were quicker and better.
- 
That’s when it hit me:

 👉 It’s not the workload that burns us out. It’s the subconscious programming beneath it.
This is why I wanted to include this hypnotherapy track in today’s newsletter as a free gift for all of you. 

You can go to your Mindvalley App and search for Hypnotic Trance Bliss.

Hypnotic Trance Bliss Wins Audio Track of the Year 
 In 2024, Paul McKenna’s Hypnotic Trance Bliss was awarded Meditation of the Year —chosen by our community of millions who had experienced its power.


But here’s the thing: what you just listened to isn’t just a meditation—it’s a glimpse into the power of hypnotherapy.
Why It Works
Paul doesn’t just talk to your conscious mind. He bypasses it.
Here’s how:
- Different commands go into your left and right ears.
- 
- Strange stories and riddles distract your logical brain.
- 
- Your conscious mind is too busy trying to “figure it out.”
- 
- Meanwhile, your subconscious just absorbs the transformation.
- 
It feels unusual. Sometimes a little weird. But that’s the point.
The old stress programs get overwritten — and you emerge into what Paul calls relaxed alertness. Calm, sharp, productive, fully present.

The McKenna-Mindvalley School of Hypnotherapy
Paul’s work has transformed my life—and the lives of thousands in our community.
A couple of years ago, we decided to take it further.
That’s why Mindvalley partnered with Paul to create the McKenna Mindvalley School of Hypnotherapy: a global training ground for mastering the art of transformation.

Why hypnotherapy?
Because science, psychology, and experience all point to one truth:
It’s not your conscious mind that runs the show. It’s your subconscious.
And when you learn to reprogram the subconscious, everything shifts—your health, your wealth, your confidence, even your relationships.
The Subconscious Is Running Your Life

If your conscious mind is the tip of the iceberg—willpower, logic, emotions, short-term memory—then your subconscious is the massive structure beneath the surface that’s far more powerful:
- Your beliefs and phobias
- 
- Your cravings and addictions
- 
- Your imagination and intuition
- 
- Your unresolved grief and fears of abandonment
- 
- Your long-term memory and protective reactions
- 
In other words: while your conscious mind thinks it’s in charge, your subconscious is the one quietly steering the ship.
This is why so many of our struggles—around money, food, confidence, even relationships—don’t change through “trying harder.”
They only change when we rewire the subconscious.
Now, let’s go deeper, 
What’s really affecting your subconscious? 
Your Stress: A Baseline On How Much Stress You Can Take Is the Silent Saboteur
When Paul joined me on The Mindvalley Show, he broke it down brilliantly:
- Stress is situational. A presentation. A deadline. Traffic.
- 
- Anxiety is ambient. That hum of dread that never switches off.
Here’s the problem: we’ve practiced stress and anxiety so much—through news, uncertainty, constant change—that our baseline is too high.
And when your baseline is high, everything feels harder:
- Creativity shrinks.
- 
- Joy disappears.
- 
- Bandwidth collapses.
The solution isn’t to remove all pressure.
It’s to reset your baseline—so you live in what Paul calls relaxed alertness.
That’s the state where you stay calm, but razor sharp. 
Productive, without panic.
Present, without drained energy.
You Don’t Lose Your Edge—You Gain Flow
High performers resist change because they fear losing their edge.
For years, my “remedy” for stress was a glass of wine.
It felt good at the moment. 
But brain scans, new research, and my own experiments proved the opposite: alcohol was raising my baseline stress, dulling my focus, and aging my brain.
The same goes for sugar, overworking, or compulsive scrolling.
Short-term relief, long-term damage.
We call them “calm.” But they’re really chains.
Listening to Paul’s Hypnotic Trance Bliss changed things.
I didn’t lose my ambition—I amplified it.
And this is the paradox: when you’re less tense, you’re more effective.
When you’re less stressed, you create more.
When you’re calmer, you lead better.
The more I practiced, the more I realized:
Our world desperately needs more people trained in hypnotherapy.
Not just for personal breakthroughs, but for helping others:
- Clearing phobias
- 
- Breaking addictions
- 
- Unlocking confidence
- 
- Healing stress and burnout
Which is why I’m thrilled to share this with you:

Pre: This summer, I found myself in Amsterdam for Mindvalley U. By chance, my Airbnb was right next to Anne Frank’s house. 

Blog Title: “Anne Frank, ICE, and Gaza: Why Her Diary Is More Urgent Than Ever”
Email Title: “Anne Frank’s warning: from ICE raids to Gaza today”

Anne Frank was 15 years old when she died in a Nazi concentration camp. Yet her words outlived her body. Words scribbled in a diary from a secret attic in Amsterdam became one of the world’s most powerful mirrors.
This summer, I found myself in Amsterdam for Mindvalley U. By chance, my Airbnb was on the street next to Anne Frank’s house. Each morning, I’d step outside and see the same canals, the same cobblestones, the same rooftops Anne may have glimpsed in stolen moments when she dared peek out from her hiding place.
A few mornings later, I opened the news and froze. The Diary of Anne Frank had just been banned in Florida schools under new book-ban laws. Imagine that. In 2025, one of the most important human documents ever written — the testimony of a teenage Jewish girl hiding from Nazi genocide — deemed “inappropriate” for children to read.
The synchronicity hit me hard. I was standing before the building where those words were written. Words that survived Anne, even though she did not. Words that outlived war, genocide, and cruelty — only to be silenced again today by politicians who fear truth more than hatred.
And this got me thinking.
If Anne Frank was alive today what would she say about America? About Israel & Gaza?
What I’m about to share may feel uncomfortable — but Anne’s words demand we face discomfort.

Who Was Anne Frank
Anne Frank was born in Frankfurt in 1929. When the Nazis rose to power, her family fled to Amsterdam, hoping to escape persecution. In 1942, when deportations began, they went into hiding in a small annex behind her father’s office. For over two years, Anne, her sister Margot, her parents Otto and Edith, and four others lived in silence, relying on the courage of Dutch friends who smuggled them food and news.
Anne wasn’t just a symbol. She was a teenager — funny, sharp, sometimes rebellious, always observant. She dreamed of being a journalist. She once wrote: “I want to go on living even after my death.” And, tragically, she did — not through her life, but through her words.
In August 1944, they were betrayed. The Gestapo stormed the annex. The Franks were deported to Westerbork, then Auschwitz, and finally Anne and Margot to Bergen-Belsen. In early 1945, both sisters died of typhus — just weeks before liberation. Anne was 15.
Only Otto Frank survived. After the war, Miep Gies, one of the helpers, handed him Anne’s diary. He published it, fulfilling her dream. Today, it has sold over 30 million copies and been translated into more than 70 languages.
Anne’s body was silenced. But her voice became immortal.

Anne’s Words in Today’s World
Anne once wrote:
“Terrible things are happening outside. Poor, helpless people are being dragged out of their homes. Families are torn apart. Children come home from school to find that their parents have disappeared.”
She was describing Nazi roundups in Amsterdam.
But doesn’t that sound eerily like ICE raids in America today? Parents taken in the middle of the night. Children left crying, bewildered, abandoned. Different time, different uniforms — but the same cruelty.
Anne also wrote:
“We are chained to one spot, without rights, a thousand obligations… waiting for the inevitable end.”
That could be the voice of Gaza today. Entire families locked in. Starved. Bombed. Denied freedom of movement. Children asking: “Why must we suffer simply because of who we are?”
Her words, written 80 years ago, read like dispatches from the present. History is not past. It is a loop — unless we break it.

A Hard, Controversial Mirror
Anne’s diary teaches us to look at cruelty honestly, no matter where it comes from. And one thing history proves: atrocities don’t start with bullets. They start with words. 
Dehumanizing language always comes first.
So let’s talk about Gaza as uncomfortable as this may seem. 
Consider the echoes:
- Nazi leadership (1943): Heinrich Himmler at Posen: “I am referring here to the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish people….”
- 
- Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (2023): On the Palestinian town of Huwara: “[Huwara] should be wiped out. I think the State of Israel should do it.”
- 
- Hitler, Mein Kampf: Jews as “the typical parasite, a sponger who, like an infectious bacillus, keeps spreading.” Nazi propaganda routinely cast Jews as vermin.
- 
- Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (2023): Announcing a siege of Gaza: “There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel… We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.”
- 
- Nazi propaganda (Goebbels echoing Hitler): Jews blamed collectively for war, threatened with “extermination.”
- 
- Israeli President Isaac Herzog (2023): “It is an entire nation out there that is responsible….” — words widely criticized as endorsing collective punishment.
- 
Nazi euphemisms: “Evacuation” as code for extermination.

Israeli Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu (2023): Suggesting a nuclear strike on Gaza was “one of the options.”

Different contexts. Different scales. But the same pattern.

Dehumanize → Justify → Destroy.
Anne Frank’s words remind us: when we hear this language, it is never “just rhetoric.” It is the runway to cruelty.
You see, cruelty always begins the same way: when leaders tell us to fear “the other.”
Fear the immigrant.
 Fear the refugee. 
Fear the neighbor who looks different. 
Fear the people beyond your border.
That is the oldest political trick in the book. And it works — unless we refuse to buy it.
Anne Frank didn’t write her diary so we could cry in museums. She wrote it so we could recognize her suffering in others — and have the courage to stop it.
Why Giving People a Chance Matters
This message hit me with even greater force because, while in Amsterdam, I also had a chance encounter.
I bumped into a young Syrian man who once worked for me back in 2016. At the time, he was a refugee in Malaysia. He and his friend had escaped a country torn apart by war. One had seen his home blown to rubble. The other had lost a brother when a bomb fell on the very place his brother was resting.
Both had lived through horrors most of us can barely imagine. And yet, when I met them, I didn’t just see refugees. I saw brilliant young minds. I saw hope, determination, and resilience.
That year, I had an idea for a new learning model called Quest and needed someone to build the app. These two young Syrians built it in record time. That app became the Mindvalley app — today used by millions worldwide and even featured in 200,000 Apple stores on the iPad.
Yes, our app was built by Syrians. Yes, it was built by refugees who were given a chance.
Anne never got her chance. But when we give people that chance, look what can happen.
This is why I am so adamant about this message. When politicians tell you to fear refugees, or immigrants, or minorities, they’re not just lying. They are robbing humanity of its future.


The Rule We Must All Live By
If there’s one rule we must all live by, it’s this:
👉 The moment a leader tells you to fear refugees, minorities, or immigrants — you are looking at a tyrant.
Do not believe them. Do not reward their fear with your silence — or your vote.
Because fear divides. And division always leads to cruelty.
What the world needs now is unity.
Unity across stripes, colors, races, and ethnicities. Unity across cultures, religions, and especially across borders.
Because the only way we solve the greatest challenges facing humanity — from climate change to war to poverty — is to remember this truth:
We are one humanity.
And kindness cannot stop at the invisible lines of race, religion, or border.


The Higher Vision
Anne Frank once wrote:
“In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.”
That may be the most extraordinary line ever written. She believed it while hiding from people who wanted her dead.
If Anne could believe in human goodness then — we can believe in it now.
Let’s prove her right.
Let’s choose compassion over cruelty.
Let’s stand up for one another across borders.
Let’s silence the voices of fear not by shouting back — but by choosing unity, again and again.
Because Anne’s diary isn’t just a warning.
It’s a torch.
And it’s in our hands now.
So here’s what we can collectively do. 
👉 Stand for unity. Across color. Across race. Across borders. Across religions.
👉 When you hear fear, answer with love.
👉 When you hear division, answer with solidarity.
👉 When a politician uses scapegoating - vote the other way. 
The only way to honor Anne is to prove her right — that humanity is good at heart. 
And that goodness becomes real when we act.
Because history doesn’t just happen to us. It is written by our choices — and our silence.
I’d like to hear from you: Drop a comment here — let’s create a conversation around unity, compassion, and what it means to stand for humanity in our time.

Preheader: At MVU Amsterdam, I asked our community these 3 questions. Now it’s your turn.

3 Questions You Need To Answer To Grow Your Business


At MVU Amsterdam, on stage, I asked the audience three simple questions about their journey as entrepreneurs 
And, the answers that came back were powerful.
I want to share the questions and some of the answers with you today. 
 
See if you relate.
Question 1: 📚 What’s the most important thing you need to learn to grow your business?
“Marketing / social media / sales.”
“How to differentiate myself.”
“Get over perfectionism and motivate myself to start doing instead of planning and perfecting” 
“Financial management.” 
“LEARN TO HIRE EFFECTIVELY” 
Question 2: 🚀 What’s stopping you from doubling your revenue?
“I don't follow an action plan. I get distracted.” 
“My fear to take risk quitting my job and bringing in danger my family” 
“I’m lacking the visibility and the operational systems. I also create an energetic barrier between myself and my wealth.”
The fear of letting go of the current practices - the ones that are NOT making money,  but are familiar. It's also the not-knowing of who to hire and when” 
“Time (as I am currently working a full-time job with 2 young kids).” 
Question 3: 👤 Who would you most like to learn from in business?
“Richard Branson because he joyfully innovates in multiple sectors. And because he is a community builder with a bigger vision of what he can help change in the world”
“Naval Ravikant — because he is practical and simple and makes so much sense.” 
“Oprah Winfrey.” 
“Vishen to integrate strategy and implementation”
“Steven Bartlett - learns so much insights from different successful people, knows how to talk about ideas”
When I read these answers, I realized: business owners aren’t just struggling with marketing hacks, funnels, or ad spend.
The deeper challenges are fear, overwhelm, lack of clarity, and self-doubt. 
And the biggest breakthroughs happen when you build the right mindset, community, and support around you.

This is What We’re Building Next
You see, we are looking at launching an Entrepreneurial Degree due to popular demand.
This degree is designed to train people on the art of scaling businesses from $5 million to $10 million and even $100 million in revenue.
As many of our Mindvalley teachers—and myself—have done.
And we’d love to get your feedback as we shape it.
Now It’s Your Turn
We are now opening up the same 3-question to you and our entire Mindvalley community today.
Because if you’re going to build a $100M business—one that lasts, one that uplifts, one that changes lives—you need more than tactics.
[Take 2 minutes to answer these questions]
Your voice will help us co-create something the world hasn’t seen before: an entrepreneurial path that scales both your business and your soul.
With love and vision,

 — Vishen
P.S.  After you take the survey, Leave a comment here and let me know what you are looking forward to with Mindvalley.

✉️Pre for Email : What Paul McKenna told me over dinner changed how I see abundance.
📝 Headline for Blog: My Dinner with Paul McKenna: The Hidden Thermostat of Wealth
The secret thermostat inside your mind (and how it controls your wealth)



The other night, I had dinner with Paul McKenna — world-renowned hypnotist, bestselling author, and now the creator of a brand-new Mindvalley audio called Hypnotic Trance for Wealth.


We weren’t in a studio. No cameras. Just a dinner table conversation. But what Paul shared that evening has been running through my head ever since. And I think it might rewire how you see money and abundance, too.
From Think and Grow Rich to Hypnotic Wealth
You’ve probably heard of Think and Grow Rich. It’s the bestselling self-help book of all time, written over 80 years ago. Its core message? You can program your subconscious to “think rich.”
Paul told me he loved that book, but two decades ago he wondered: with today’s breakthroughs in psychology and hypnosis, could I do something even more powerful?
That one thought set the universe into motion.
Synchronicities Start Showing Up
The very next evening, Paul found himself at a dinner party sitting next to Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop.
Before he could even explain what he was working on, Anita interrupted: “Yes. I’ve got a feeling. I want to study how your mind works.”
Two days later, Richard Branson called him, asking him to lead an event. Paul agreed — but only if Branson allowed him to “model” his thinking. Branson said yes, and later even wrote the foreword to Paul’s book.
Not long after, billionaire Sir David Barclay told him: “You’re going to meet many wealthy people who aren’t truly rich. All they have is money. True wealth also means health, love, joy, and deep relationships.”
And so Paul set out not just to decode how the world’s wealthiest create abundance, but how they live rich lives.
The Richard Branson Principle
One of the stories Paul shared blew me away.
In the 1970s, Branson was sitting on a miserable flight. Bad food, bad headphones, one small TV for the entire cabin. And he thought: “If I had my own airline, I’d do everything differently.”
In his mind, he began designing Virgin Atlantic — personal TVs, glamorous lounges, good food, the works.
But how could he afford a jet? Buying one would bankrupt him. So he asked Boeing if he could lease instead. They said yes. And Virgin Airlines was born.
Branson explained his strategy:
👉 Upside/Downside Thinking
- If the downside risk is small but the upside is massive → take bold action.
- 
- If the downside is catastrophic → rethink.
- 
- Always mitigate risk (like leasing instead of buying).
- 
And this is how true wealth creators think. They find the upside, reduce the downside, and then leap.
Adding Value vs Perceived Value
Branson also taught Paul something simple but profound: you’re rewarded for the value — or the perceived value — you bring to others.
That’s why supermodels can earn more than doctors. It’s about the way society perceives and rewards value.
So whether you’re an entrepreneur or working within a company, the wealthiest path is always this: find ways to make people’s lives easier, better, or more beautiful.
The Wealth Thermostat
But here’s where Paul went deeper.
Most people don’t lose wealth because of lack of opportunity. They lose it because of their internal wealth thermostat.
- Lottery winners lose it within a few years.
- 
- Inheritance often vanishes.
- 
- Even when new money flows in, the subconscious “resets” it back down.
- 
- 
Paul realized he had the same thermostat. His father was a builder — money would flow in, then disappear. Paul repeated the same pattern in his early career.
Until he hypnotically changed it.
And when he did, everything changed. His finances grew. His health improved. He stopped burning out. He got happily married. And he realized: resetting your wealth thermostat isn’t just about money — it rewires your entire life.
My Own Wealth Thermostat Test
I confessed something to Paul that night.
I’d been searching for a new home. My initial budget was $8–12K a month. But nothing fit: no space for the kids when they visit, no studio for Kristina and me to record podcasts.
So I stretched to $15K. Still nothing that felt right.
Then I found the perfect place. Spacious. Beautiful energy. Enough room for courses, podcasts, even dinners for 20 guests. But it was $17K — $60,000 a year more than I’d budgeted.
My fear: was I being irresponsible?
Paul’s answer was simple:
👉 “Will this space allow you to generate more than the extra $60K?”
Yes. Absolutely. I could record a new course in that space and make that in weeks.
Paul reframed it through Branson’s principle:
- Downside = $60K.
- 
- Upside = Creativity, abundance, community, new income.
- 
- Risk = None (I wasn’t going into debt).
That wasn’t poor thinking. That was rich thinking.
And it made me realize: expanding your environment is also expanding your signal to yourself. You’re telling your subconscious: “I deserve this. I can hold more.”
Rich Kids vs Ordinary Kids
Paul also pointed out another insight: children of wealthy families rarely struggle with money blocks.
Why? Because they grow up assuming abundance is natural.
At elite schools like Eton, math problems aren’t about apples and oranges. They’re about running companies or managing resources. The assumption baked into their education is that they will lead, they will create wealth, they will shape the world.
Paul smiled and said: “It’s never too late to have a wealthy childhood.”
That’s exactly what Hypnotic Trance for Wealth does: it gives your subconscious an alternative history. 
One where you grew up surrounded by love, support, and abundance. And from that past, your mind naturally generates a new, abundant future.
Hypnotic Trance for Wealth
So here’s the big takeaway from that dinner with Paul:
True wealth isn’t just about money. It’s about resetting your thermostat so you can hold more joy, more health, more love, and yes — more abundance.
That’s what Paul’s Hypnotic Trance for Wealth is designed to do. 
In just 38 minutes, it:
✔ Removes subconscious money blocks
 ✔ Resets your wealth thermostat
 ✔ Rewrites your “wealthy childhood”
 ✔ Trains your subconscious to notice abundance (and attract more of it)
 ✔ Aligns you with the same strategies used by billionaires

One More Thing…
If you’ve been following our launch of our 2025 Mindvalley Certified Hypnotherapist Program with Paul McKenna — the very path where Paul personally guides you to reset deep subconscious patterns around wealth, health, self-worth, and success over a transformational 4-month journey starting this Sep —
Here’s something you need to know:
Application deadline for this program is today, Sep 9 at 11:59pm PST.
And as of this writing, 463 seats are already taken out of 800 — leaving just 337 spots remaining for this year’s cohort.
 👉 Apply here to secure your spot today 
But this is not about a deadline, 
This is your chance to finally remove the subconscious blocks that have quietly shaped your entire life. 
These hidden blocks are often the root of:
- Financial ceilings you can’t seem to break
- 
- Repeating toxic patterns in relationships
- 
- Low self-worth despite success
- 
- Procrastination or burnout, even when you're passionate
Most people try to fix these on the surface. But without addressing the subconscious source, the patterns return — just in different forms.
Now here's the gift of hypnotherapy: It doesn’t just help you understand the problem.
It helps you rewire it at the deepest level — so you naturally begin to act, think, and create from a place of confidence, clarity, and alignment.
This is the only time this year you can join this certification with Paul at the current pricing. The next special intake happens a year later — and it will come at a significantly higher investment.

If you have any questions regarding the program and need someone you can talk to - Book a 30-min call with our team and we will map the best course of action for you.
Final Thought
That night, I realized wealth is less about your bank account, and more about the questions you dare to ask yourself.
Richard Branson asked, “If I had an airline, how would I design it?”

I asked, “Do I deserve to step into a bigger space?”
Because the truth is this: it’s never too late to have a wealthy childhood. And it’s never too late to reprogram your subconscious for abundance.
What about you? What question could reframe your thermostat? Leave a comment here to let me know (i read every single one!)
With love,

🚧 The 7 Biggest Hurdles Entrepreneurs Face — And How to Break Through Them

Entrepreneurship is often sold as freedom.
But for most founders — especially in the early or growth stages — it doesn’t feel like freedom.
It feels like friction.
We surveyed hundreds of entrepreneurs inside the Mindvalley community, across industries and revenue levels — from early-stage solopreneurs to 7-figure founders scaling to their next level.
And what we found was loud and clear:
The biggest blocks to scale aren’t strategy or tools.
They’re misaligned mindset, unclear offers, lack of systems, and outdated identity.
So if you’re feeling stuck, burned out, or plateaued — you’re not alone.
And you’re not broken.
Here are the 7 most common hurdles entrepreneurs face, and how to break through them — based on feedback from our global community and insights from the speakers of the upcoming Entrepreneurship Mastery Summit, happening Sept 26–28.

Here Are The 7 Big Blocks And Lessons To Help You Overcome Them:

1. 🧭 Too Many Ideas, No Clear Path
“I have five business models in my head and no idea which one to commit to.”
“I’m doing too much… and nothing’s working.”
🔍 What’s Really Going On:
- You’re drowning in decision fatigue
- 
- You’ve consumed dozens of courses but lack integration
- 
- You’re in permanent beta mode, not execution
💡 What Breaks It:
“Clarity is a system — not a mood.”
On Day 1 of the Summit, billionaire Naveen Jain and I will walk you through how to anchor your vision, clarify your path, and build a business that actually serves your life — not consumes it.
We’ll talk about how to find clarity even when you’re flooded with ideas, how to filter what’s truly worth pursuing, and how to design a future that pulls you forward.
One powerful question we’ll teach you to ask:
Does this idea serve the next version of me — or just distract me from it?

2. 💸 Revenue That’s Inconsistent or Capped
“I can’t seem to break past $10K/month.”
 “My income is random — feast or famine.”
🔍 What’s Really Going On:
- You’re selling but not scaling
- 
- Your pricing doesn’t reflect your value
- 
- There’s no system for repeatable revenue
- 
💡 What Breaks It:
Day 1 of the Summit is your Monetization Makeover — featuring:
- Kim Perell, a self-made serial entrepreneur, bestselling author of ""The Execution Factor,"" and one of the most influential women in tech. Kim scaled her first company from a $10K investment to over $100M in revenue — and eventually sold it for over $250 million. She’s been named one of the most powerful women in business by Forbes and has helped dozens of founders do the same.
- 
- Sonia Ricotti, a master of digital content sales and the creator of one of the most successful webinar funnel systems in the personal development industry. She’s built a multimillion-dollar coaching and training business using her signature ""Unsinkable"" system — and even Mindvalley has adopted some of her methods because of how well they convert.
- 
You’ll walk away with:
- A full audit framework for your revenue streams
- 
- A roadmap to build a simple evergreen funnel
- 
- A blueprint for your Ascension Model to grow LTV
- 
If you’re always chasing cash, you’re always in survival.

My goal is to help you move into strategy, where cashflow becomes a design — not a guess.
3. 🧩 An Offer That’s Unclear or Unsellable
“People say they love what I do — but they never buy.”
 “I can’t explain what I sell in one sentence.”
🔍 What’s Really Going On:
- Your offer is too broad or abstract
- 
- It doesn’t solve a painful, urgent problem
- 
- You’re not positioned with clarity or proof
- 
💡 What Breaks It:
“Clarity = magnetism.”
If your offer isn’t selling — it’s probably not clear enough, powerful enough, or structured to scale.
That’s why on Day 2, I invited Dave Asprey to teach you what it means to build a product and message so sharp, it slices through the noise.
This is a man who:
- Took butter coffee and turned it into a $100M+ brand, Bulletproof
- 
- Coined an entirely new industry: biohacking — now a global movement
- 
- Then built one of the world’s top health podcasts
- 
- Then scaled multiple new brands in wellness, supplements, and longevity
- 
- And through it all — kept creating clear, bold, category-defining offers
- 
He didn’t stop. He kept building brands that scale with story, strategy, and soul.
And that’s exactly what he’s teaching you:
How to make your offer unforgettable — and magnetic.
If you’ve ever struggled to explain what you do…
If you’ve ever felt like “my stuff is good, but it’s not selling”…
This session alone might change everything.
4. 📉 Marketing That Feels Like Screaming into the Void
“I’m posting, but no one’s engaging.”
 “I’m doing all the things — and nothing is converting.”
🔍 What’s Really Going On:
- No clear brand narrative
- 
- No authority engine
- 
- You’re missing the bridge from content → conversions
- 
💡 What Breaks It:
Day 3 brings Daniel Priestley, one of the world’s top marketing minds (and most frequent guest on Diary of a CEO).

You’ll build your:
- Authority Engine (your content → lead system)
- 
- Magnetic Message (truth-based positioning)
- 
- Minimum Viable Funnel (built to convert with soul)
- 
Daniel was one of the highest-rated speakers at Mindvalley U for a reason.
5. 🔄 You’re Doing Everything Yourself
“I’m the CEO, the admin, the coach, and the content team.”
 “If I stop, the business stops.”
🔍 What’s Really Going On:
- No delegation or ops system
- 
- No hiring process or SOPs
- 
- You haven’t built a machine — you’ve built a cage
- 
💡 What Breaks It:
On Day 2, we’ll dive into:
- The $10K/hour filter: What you should never do again
- 
- How to hire your first (or next) A-player
- 
- How to build AI agents that run tasks for under $10/year
- 
- When to use humans vs automation
I’ll also show you how I scaled Mindvalley past $100M in revenue without VC funding, using exactly these principles.
6. 😤 You’re Smart… But You’re Still Stuck
“I know what to do. I just can’t seem to do it.”
 “I’m terrified of launching.”
🔍 What’s Really Going On:
- Fear of visibility or failure
- 
- Inner identity misalignment
- 
- Self-sabotage via perfectionism
- 
💡 What Breaks It:
A recent study shared by Predictable Profits showed that:
Entrepreneurs who focused on mindset and psychological training grew profits by 30%, compared to just 11% growth in those who focused only on technical business skills.
On Day 2, you’ll meet:
- Shade Zahrai, who helps founders overcome imposter syndrome and step into leadership
- 
- Verne Harnish, founder of EO (Entrepreneurs’ Organization), sharing strategies from thousands of top entrepreneurs
- 
This day will reboot your mindset and rewire your fear — from the inside out.
7. 🕒 You’re Out of Time, Energy, and Headspace
“I love my business, but I feel like it’s running me.”
 “I don’t want to burn out building this thing.”
🔍 What’s Really Going On:
- Poor calendar design
- 
- No clear “Founder Operating System”
- 
- Scaling chaos instead of scaling flow
- 
💡 What Breaks It:
On Day 3, you’ll learn from:
- Miki Agrawal, founder of 3 $100M+ companies
- 
- Kwame Christian, negotiation expert and one of the top speakers on our stage this past year. 
- And I’ll share how I rebuilt my own calendar and team to create more energy and ease — even while scaling
You’ll design a new rhythm for your business that supports joy, not just output.

Blog Title: Jobbing Your Love & The Business You’re Meant to Build.

Sub: Stop listening to some people…but WATCH the dots.

Pre: The dots you’ve been ignoring may be the key to your $100M business.

Stop listening to some people…but WATCH the dots. 

Maybe you should stop listening to some people. Seriously.
Because one of the biggest problems I see with people who dream of being entrepreneurs is this:
Early ideas that are brilliant get killed way too fast because they’re judged through the lens of a business model and not through the lens of originality.
And if you’ve ever had an idea that lit you up, but you killed it because someone told you it wasn’t “practical,” you know exactly what I mean.
Here’s a list of bad advice I got early on. If I had listened, I would have lost hundreds of millions in revenue:
- “You’re selling meditation CDs online? That’s not a real business. That’s a hobby.” — from a well-meaning aunt.
- 
- “That’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard.” — on my festival idea, from an investor I met at Summit Series in 2010. If I’d listened we would not have A-Fest, Future Human or Mindvalley U, festivals that attract thousands and are now in their 15th year. 
- 
- “That will never scale.” — from an early Twitter investor in Silicon Valley. The business in question Mindvalley Mastery, is now at $30M in revenue in year 3 and grew 60% year on year. 
If I had listened to any of these people, Mindvalley wouldn’t exist.
Because business isn’t just about logic.
It’s about heart. It’s about Intuition. It’s about Passion.

And nobody knows this about you better than YOU.
And to show you why, let me tell you a story about a man with a weird passion for fonts.

The Daydreamer at Reed College
This young man was the son of a Syrian father and adopted American parents.
He enrolled in Reed College, a small liberal arts school in Portland, Oregon.
But he struggled.
He couldn’t focus on classes. He was restless. A daydreamer.
Except for one subject.
One class completely grabbed his attention: calligraphy.
He became obsessed with fonts. The curves. The flow. The way letters could feel elegant or clumsy depending on a single stroke.
His friends thought it was strange. Useless.
But to him, it was art.
Years later, he and a buddy started a small personal computer company.
Nothing unusual. There were 20 other computer companies in the late 1970s.
But their machine was different.
It came with fonts. Beautiful fonts.
An obsession that came directly from his calligraphy class.
That “useless” hobby became one of the defining features of the product.
And this wasn’t his only edge.
He had three:
- Design. He cared deeply about beauty and elegance.
- 
- Storytelling. He could inspire people with vision.
- 
- Consumer tech. He had an intuitive feel for what ordinary people wanted.
- 
The fusion of those three passions created Apple. That font obsessed man was Steve Jobs. 
And years later, Apple became the world’s first trillion-dollar company.
Now imagine if someone had told him: “Nobody cares about fonts. Just build a computer.”
Apple wouldn’t be Apple.
The Magic of Your Dots
Steve Jobs famously said: “You cannot connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backward.”
So the question is: what are your dots?
What were those passions, weird obsessions, little sparks that lit you up?
Those may be the signposts for the business you were meant to build.
Your dots may have magic in them.

Connecting My Own Dots
When I look back at my life, I see them clearly.
- I loved meditation. So in 2002, when the e-commerce boom hit, I built my first website around meditation CDs. People told me there wasn’t much money in it. I told them I didn’t care. I wanted to do what I loved. Boy, were they wrong. Meditation blew up in the 2010s. Today, the Mindvalley app alone is a $100M revenue business.
- 
- I loved festivals, music, and travel. So I created A-Fest. Critics said it was a terrible idea. Today, it’s in its 13th year and has expanded into Future Human in Dubai and Mindvalley University.
- 
- I loved books. So I wrote one. That first book, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, hit #1 globally on Amazon.
- 
- I loved dabbling in AI. So I started an AI training company. That evolved into Mindvalley Mastery, which crossed $30M revenue in its third year.
- 
These weren’t logical career moves.
They were dots.
And when I fused them together, I built not just one business—but an ecosystem of businesses.
What are YOUR dots? 
What are those weird passions, quirks, obsessions, hobbies that you love but others find weird?
There might be GOLD in them. 
Here are the five principles that guided me. I hope you find these useful too. 
1. Don’t Quit Your Day Job (Yet). Build on the Side. 
Quitting too early is the fastest way to anxiety.
Because now you’re not creating. You’re panicking about rent.
I stayed at my job.
As hard as it was, when I came home, I gave myself a rule:
- 90 minutes every night to teach myself the skills I needed. I learned PHP coding. Built checkout flows. JavaScript. Everything by hand.
- 
- Six hours every weekend were sacred building time.
- 
Six months later, my first website went live.
One year later, it covered my expenses.
Only then did I quit.
That’s how Mindvalley started: slowly, but safely.
2. Master One Skill—Then Fuse It With What You Love
Here’s a secret no one tells you: the fastest way to build a career around your love is to marry your passion with a craft.
I call them two types of passions:
- Craft-Passions: skills you can master through practice (like sales, design, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, humorous video ads, comedy, vibe coding, or AI prompt engineering).
- 
- Cause-Passions: the ideas and movements that light up your soul (like meditation, health, education, or sustainability).
- 
Your real leverage comes when you fuse the two.
For me, sales was a Craft-Passion. I didn’t “love” it at first, but I loved mastering it. I studied it, practiced it, read every book I could.
Meditation was my Cause-Passion.
When I fused them—sales + meditation—I created copy so compelling for meditation CDs that I became the top affiliate in the world for the company I was reselling for. 
Eventually that led to Mindvalley. 
That’s the breakthrough: I wasn’t just into meditation. I was into the alchemy of passions—turning Craft into Cause.
3. Redefine Success Beyond Money
The Mindvalley model of entrepreneurship has always been about balance. And the data now fully supports it.
Shawn Achor, in The Happiness Advantage, shows that:
- Doctors are 19% more accurate in their diagnoses when they’re happy.
- 
- Optimistic salespeople close deals 55% more effectively.
- 
Happiness isn’t a side effect of success. Happiness drives success.
Hard work is hustle porn.
It works if you’re 20, living on Red Bull and ramen.
But for adults? It’s incomplete.
Humans need joy. Meaning. Connection.
So when you’re building your business, set boundaries:
- Maybe you stop work at 7:30 p.m. so you can have dinner with your family.
- 
- Maybe you block 4:00–5:30 p.m. every day for exercise.
- 
- Maybe your first task every morning isn’t email—it’s meditation.
- 
These boundaries don’t slow you down.
They fuel you.
4. Question the Rules
In my book The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, I introduced the idea of Brules—bullshit rules.
Here’s the thing: humans create rules to feel safe. Passed from father to son, mother to daughter.
But the world changes fast.
And old rules often don’t apply anymore.
What rules might you still be following?
- “You need a steady paycheck before you try anything.”
- 
- “Don’t start unless you have investors.”
- 
- “Stick to one career your whole life.”
- 
- “Keep your ideas realistic.”
- 
Each one sounds safe.
Each one kills originality.
That’s why extraordinary entrepreneurs question the rules.
And torch the Brules.

5. Build Identity, Not Just Goals
Most people set goals like:
- “I want to start a business.”
- 
- “I want to make X amount.”
- 
But goals without identity are fragile. They collapse under stress.
The real breakthrough comes when you adopt an identity:
- I am an entrepreneur.
- 
- I am a creator.
- 
- I am a teacher.
- 
James Clear, in Atomic Habits, writes that identity is the deepest driver of behavior. When you embody the identity, the actions follow naturally.
When I started identifying as a teacher—even before Mindvalley existed—I began to notice opportunities to teach everywhere. That identity pulled me forward.
So don’t just set goals. Ask: Who am I becoming? 
Because the universe responds not to what you want, but to who you are.
This (and a lot more) is exactly what we’ll dive into at the Entrepreneurship Summit.

[COACH LIST VISHEN’S NEWSLETTER - Sep 23] 

Sub: Stop listening to some people…but WATCH the dots.

Pre: The dots you’ve been ignoring may be the key to your $100M business.

Stop listening to some people…but WATCH the dots. 

Maybe you should stop listening to some people. Seriously.
Because one of the biggest problems I see with people who dream of being entrepreneurs is this:
Early ideas that are brilliant get killed way too fast because they’re judged through the lens of a business model and not through the lens of originality.
And if you’ve ever had an idea that lit you up, but you killed it because someone told you it wasn’t “practical,” you know exactly what I mean.
Here’s a list of bad advice I got early on. If I had listened, I would have lost hundreds of millions in revenue:
- “You’re selling meditation CDs online? That’s not a real business. That’s a hobby.” — from a well-meaning aunt.
- 
- “That’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard.” — on my festival idea, from an investor I met at Summit Series in 2010. If I’d listened we would not have A-Fest, Future Human or Mindvalley U, festivals that attract thousands and are now in their 15th year. 
- 
- “That will never scale.” — from an early Twitter investor in Silicon Valley. The business in question Mindvalley Mastery, is now at $30M in revenue in year 3 and grew 60% year on year. 
If I had listened to any of these people, Mindvalley wouldn’t exist.
Because business isn’t just about logic.
It’s about heart. It’s about Intuition. It’s about Passion.

And nobody knows this about you better than YOU.
And to show you why, let me tell you a story about a man with a weird passion for fonts.

The Daydreamer at Reed College
This young man was the son of a Syrian father and adopted American parents.
He enrolled in Reed College, a small liberal arts school in Portland, Oregon.
But he struggled.
He couldn’t focus on classes. He was restless. A daydreamer.
Except for one subject.
One class completely grabbed his attention: calligraphy.
He became obsessed with fonts. The curves. The flow. The way letters could feel elegant or clumsy depending on a single stroke.
His friends thought it was strange. Useless.
But to him, it was art.
Years later, he and a buddy started a small personal computer company.
Nothing unusual. There were 20 other computer companies in the late 1970s.
But their machine was different.
It came with fonts. Beautiful fonts.
An obsession that came directly from his calligraphy class.
That “useless” hobby became one of the defining features of the product.
And this wasn’t his only edge.
He had three:
- Design. He cared deeply about beauty and elegance.
- 
- Storytelling. He could inspire people with vision.
- 
- Consumer tech. He had an intuitive feel for what ordinary people wanted.
- 
The fusion of those three passions created Apple. That font obsessed man was Steve Jobs. 
And years later, Apple became the world’s first trillion-dollar company.
Now imagine if someone had told him: “Nobody cares about fonts. Just build a computer.”
Apple wouldn’t be Apple.
The Magic of Your Dots
Steve Jobs famously said: “You cannot connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backward.”
So the question is: what are your dots?
What were those passions, weird obsessions, little sparks that lit you up?
Those may be the signposts for the business you were meant to build.
Your dots may have magic in them.

Connecting My Own Dots
When I look back at my life, I see them clearly.
- I loved meditation. So in 2002, when the e-commerce boom hit, I built my first website around meditation CDs. People told me there wasn’t much money in it. I told them I didn’t care. I wanted to do what I loved. Boy, were they wrong. Meditation blew up in the 2010s. Today, the Mindvalley app alone is a $100M revenue business.
- 
- I loved festivals, music, and travel. So I created A-Fest. Critics said it was a terrible idea. Today, it’s in its 13th year and has expanded into Future Human in Dubai and Mindvalley University.
- 
- I loved books. So I wrote one. That first book, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, hit #1 globally on Amazon.
- 
- I loved dabbling in AI. So I started an AI training company. That evolved into Mindvalley Mastery, which crossed $30M revenue in its third year.
- 
These weren’t logical career moves.
They were dots.
And when I fused them together, I built not just one business—but an ecosystem of businesses.
What are YOUR dots? 
What are those weird passions, quirks, obsessions, hobbies that you love but others find weird?
There might be GOLD in them. 
Here are the five principles that guided me. I hope you find these useful too. 
1. Don’t Quit Your Day Job (Yet). Build on the Side. 
Quitting too early is the fastest way to anxiety.
Because now you’re not creating. You’re panicking about rent.
I stayed at my job.
As hard as it was, when I came home, I gave myself a rule:
- 90 minutes every night to teach myself the skills I needed. I learned PHP coding. Built checkout flows. JavaScript. Everything by hand.
- 
- Six hours every weekend were sacred building time.
- 
Six months later, my first website went live.
One year later, it covered my expenses.
Only then did I quit.
That’s how Mindvalley started: slowly, but safely.
2. Master One Skill—Then Fuse It With What You Love
Here’s a secret no one tells you: the fastest way to build a career around your love is to marry your passion with a craft.
I call them two types of passions:
- Craft-Passions: skills you can master through practice (like sales, design, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, humorous video ads, comedy, vibe coding, or AI prompt engineering).
- 
- Cause-Passions: the ideas and movements that light up your soul (like meditation, health, education, or sustainability).
- 
Your real leverage comes when you fuse the two.
For me, sales was a Craft-Passion. I didn’t “love” it at first, but I loved mastering it. I studied it, practiced it, read every book I could.
Meditation was my Cause-Passion.
When I fused them—sales + meditation—I created copy so compelling for meditation CDs that I became the top affiliate in the world for the company I was reselling for. 
Eventually that led to Mindvalley. 
That’s the breakthrough: I wasn’t just into meditation. I was into the alchemy of passions—turning Craft into Cause.
3. Redefine Success Beyond Money
The Mindvalley model of entrepreneurship has always been about balance. And the data now fully supports it.
Shawn Achor, in The Happiness Advantage, shows that:
- Doctors are 19% more accurate in their diagnoses when they’re happy.
- 
- Optimistic salespeople close deals 55% more effectively.
- 
Happiness isn’t a side effect of success. Happiness drives success.
Hard work is hustle porn.
It works if you’re 20, living on Red Bull and ramen.
But for adults? It’s incomplete.
Humans need joy. Meaning. Connection.
So when you’re building your business, set boundaries:
- Maybe you stop work at 7:30 p.m. so you can have dinner with your family.
- 
- Maybe you block 4:00–5:30 p.m. every day for exercise.
- 
- Maybe your first task every morning isn’t email—it’s meditation.
- 
These boundaries don’t slow you down.
They fuel you.
4. Question the Rules
In my book The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, I introduced the idea of Brules—bullshit rules.
Here’s the thing: humans create rules to feel safe. Passed from father to son, mother to daughter.
But the world changes fast.
And old rules often don’t apply anymore.
What rules might you still be following?
- “You need a steady paycheck before you try anything.”
- 
- “Don’t start unless you have investors.”
- 
- “Stick to one career your whole life.”
- 
- “Keep your ideas realistic.”
- 
Each one sounds safe.
Each one kills originality.
That’s why extraordinary entrepreneurs question the rules.
And torch the Brules.

5. Build Identity, Not Just Goals
Most people set goals like:
- “I want to start a business.”
- 
- “I want to make X amount.”
- 
But goals without identity are fragile. They collapse under stress.
The real breakthrough comes when you adopt an identity:
- I am an entrepreneur.
- 
- I am a creator.
- 
- I am a teacher.
- 
James Clear, in Atomic Habits, writes that identity is the deepest driver of behavior. When you embody the identity, the actions follow naturally.
When I started identifying as a teacher—even before Mindvalley existed—I began to notice opportunities to teach everywhere. That identity pulled me forward.
So don’t just set goals. Ask: Who am I becoming? 
Because the universe responds not to what you want, but to who you are.
This (and a lot more) is exactly what we’ll dive into at the Entrepreneurship Summit.

If You Are A Coach Or A Consultant We’ve Made The Summit Even More Powerful For You.. 
When I first started out, I wasn’t running a global company.
I was a facilitator for the Silva Method, teaching meditation in small classrooms.
Back then, I was making around $5,000 a month.
Fast forward a few years, and that side hustle grew into what is now Mindvalley: a business generating over $12 million a month and impacting millions of students worldwide.
That’s why I believe if you’re a coach, trainer, consultant, or hypnotherapist — you have an incredible opportunity right now.
To make scaling your coaching business even more powerful:  
Ajit Nawalkha — one of the top experts in building coaching businesses — will be joining us LIVE at Entrepreneurship Summit to share exactly how to turn your practice into a thriving business model.
The truth is, the world needs your voice, your skills, and your perspective more than ever.
And scaling impact as a coach requires more than just mastery of your craft.

Pre: The data might surprise you: the real reason fear wins in politics (and who it’s costing most).


Compassion Hijacking: How We’re Being Brainwashed to Hate Immigrants
Today, I’m about to take the stage at one of Asia’s biggest human resources conferences—alongside one of my personal idols, physicist Dr. Michio Kaku.
My talk will be about how we’ve used AI at Mindvalley to accelerate productivity, creativity, and innovation. It’s a story that’s made our company an academic case study in AI transformation.
But I’ll also address something darker—something that’s hijacking our minds, our votes, and our shared humanity.
It’s the way AI is being used not to elevate us—but to divide us.
We see it every time we open TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube and get served content that perfectly matches our outrage.
So today’s newsletter is about this darker side of AI.
It’s about how AI is being weaponized to divide society.
And how ALL of us, but the immigrant and the person marching to get them out - are both being hijacked to serve a greater political purpose. 
Let’s Begin with the Algorithm
Not the kind that builds robots.
The kind that feeds you headlines. Curates your outrage. Hijacks your empathy.
The kind that fuels TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, and X.
These algorithms don’t just reflect your beliefs.
They sculpt them.
And here’s the uncomfortable truth:
AI doesn’t care about democracy.
AI cares about dopamine.
It optimizes for one thing: engagement.
And the fastest way to get engagement?
Fear.
Outrage.
Division.
So what do we get?
Not truth.
Not nuance.
We get emotional bait.
Headlines like:
“Trump ends the H1B Visa program.”
 “Democrats halt the government because they want healthcare for illegals.”
And who benefits from this firehose of emotional manipulation?
Not the wise.
Not the kind.
But those most willing to say anything—no matter the cost.
And right now, the cost is being paid by immigrants.
The very people we once promised to welcome, protect, and uplift.


America — The Immigrant Myth

Let’s start with the United States, where this lie has taken root the deepest.

In his recent speech at the United Nations, Trump declared that the U.S. government is being shut down because Democrats want to give healthcare to illegal immigrants.

Sounds outrageous, right?

Here’s what he doesn’t tell you:

The actual portion of the U.S. healthcare budget that goes to undocumented immigrants?
< 1%

That’s not a typo. Emergency Medicaid expenditures for undocumented immigrants are estimated to be less than 1% of Medicaid’s total spending.

That’s for emergencies—like if someone is bleeding out on a highway after getting hit by a car. The American way is to save a life.

The alternative? Let them die.

But 1% is still something right? That could be going to regular Americans. How dare those undocumented folks leech on tax paying Americans. 

Now there’s the other great myth that the White House is perpetuating. 

Far from draining the system, undocumented immigrants contribute $97 billion in taxes annually—equivalent to the tax output of the entire state of Ohio.

Yes you read that right. The average undocumented immigrant in America actually contributes between $8K to $10K a YEAR in tax revenue. 

Now imagine everyone in Ohio being told they’re not allowed to access any healthcare—even emergency care—despite paying taxes.

And when people say, “Well, they came here illegally,” let’s talk history:

For decades, the U.S. had a rotating door policy with Mexico.
Undocumented labor was quietly welcomed to do the jobs Americans wouldn’t.
Reagan tolerated it.
Bush tolerated it.
It only became a “crisis” when fear became a campaign strategy.
I want to be very clear, I'm not suggesting we allow illegal immigrants into countries, countries have border policies for a reason. 
America spends $25 Billion in budgeted per year for policing its border. What I am against is the villainization of undocumented migrants, the tearing apart of their families, people not having the right to - due process and fair trial – because these are tactics that dictators use. 
As a conscious civilized society we need to be very very aware of these tactics. 
Obama himself deported $3M people from the United  but it was done with due process - there are fairer, safer ways to deal with illegal immigrants.
But before we move on lets talk about crime. Trump has been suggesting that undocumented immigrants contribute vastly to crime. Data from the Cato Institute tells another story.

- Undocumented immigrants are 41% less likely to be incarcerated than Americans. 

- Documented immigrants are 74% less likely to be incarcerated.

Immigrants are by FAR less likely to engage in criminal behaviour. But of course, it’s not convenient to tell the truth. 

If you think this hysteria only affects undocumented workers, think again.

What Happened When I Tried To Build A Company In America

Let me tell you why Mindvalley—a global personal growth company—was forced to leave the U.S.
In 2004, I was legally living in New York. Visa approved. Business thriving.
Then, I was added to a federal watchlist.
 It was called Special Registration—a Bush-era policy targeting people from Muslim-majority countries.
Here’s the irony:
 I’m Hindu. And baptized Orthodox Christian.
 But because I held a Malaysian passport—from a peaceful, developed country with a Muslim-majority population—I was flagged.
For four years, I couldn’t fly in or out of the U.S. without a two-hour interrogation.
 Every four weeks, I had to report to the NYPD.
I’d arrive at airports earlier than everyone else to sit in a room with agents who often asked, “How are you even on this list?”
They knew it was absurd. But the system didn’t care.
So I left.
And I moved my company to Malaysia—not for lower taxes or talent, but because I refused to be treated like a suspect for carrying the “wrong” passport.
We built something extraordinary.
 Mindvalley now operates globally, has created thousands of jobs, and impacts people in over 100 countries.
And I made a promise:
If I couldn’t build in America, I’d recreate everything I loved about America in my own hood.
This is why Mindvalley became the first company in Asia to win the World’s Most Democratic Workplace award. It’s also why our office made Inc Magazine Top 10 Most Beautiful Offices in the World in 2012 and 2019. I recreated everything I loved about Silicon Valley culture in Asia and helped these ideas spread. 
Eventually, President Obama declared Special Registration unconstitutional.
But in 2016, Trump tried to bring it back—under a new name: The Muslim Watchlist.
Only this time, social media was awake.
People protested. CEOs like Sergey Brin marched in the streets. Trump backed down.
But the same fear-mongering I lived through is now being used again.
 To divide.
 To distract.
 To scapegoat.
Europe — The Numbers, The Narrative, and My Uncle at Dinner
A few nights ago, I was having dinner with a family member.
He said, “You know, Vishen, Europe is finally waking up. Crime is going up because they’ve let in too many immigrants.”
He’s not even European. But he’s been watching the wrong YouTube channels.
I looked him in the eye and said, “Let’s look at the data together.”
Yes—many Europeans say they feel unsafe.
 That fear is real.
 I feel it too.
 I don’t wear a watch when walking around certain parts of London.
But that fear isn’t being caused by immigrants.
Multiple academic studies across Europe and the U.S. have found no correlation between increased immigration and increased violent crime. (I’ve linked to all of them in the blog post version of this article). 
But it goes further. Despite what Trump says, crime across the world and especially in Europe and the USA are plummeting. 
Why? Because as humans, we grow.
We evolve.
We become more conscious.
Anyone telling you otherwise is hijacking your fear—for votes.
This chart from Steven Pinker’s excellent book on why we need to be optimistic about the future shows just how much crime is decreasing. It looks at homicides but the same is true for almost all levels of crime (the book is an excellent read!)

Trump’s Speech at the UN and his claim that the rest of the world is “going to hell”. 
By now you should probably have read that Trump’s speech at the UN was widely seen as factually incorrect and described by many pundits as the worst speech any sitting American President has ever given on a public stage. 
Trump says, “Look at Germany! Almost half the prisoners are foreigners!”
He’s not wrong—on the surface.
In Germany, around 48% of prisoners are foreign nationals.
But Germany is part of the EU.
 “Foreign” includes people from Italy, Poland, France—people who move freely within the union.
But we have to look better. Of the total incarcerated in Germany who are foreign nationals roughly 70% were non-EU nationals. And many were just the people Trump vilified. Afghans, Syrians and other refugees and people of lets just say browner skin complexion. So let’s examine data and see if it’s true that such people cause higher crime rates. 
First let’s zoom out.
Since the 1990s, immigration in Europe has increased by two-thirds.
In that same period, crime has dropped by a third. (All data sources in the blog post related to this article). 
So if crime is falling and immigration is rising, the narrative falls apart.
But still something seems off. 
Why are there so many foreigners in jails in Europe? 
Here the analysis is simple. 
Here’s what the science of crime shows us:
1. Most crimes are committed by men.
2.  Globally, men make up the overwhelming majority of both criminals and victims. In the UK, three out of four people arrested or charged are male.
3. 
4. It spikes in young adulthood.
5.  Crime—especially violent crime—peaks in the late teens to early 30s. In almost every country, young men under 35 commit the highest share of crimes.
6. 
7. Most refugees and migrants in Europe?
8.  You guessed it: young men under 35. That’s because they’re the ones most likely to take the risk of fleeing war zones, walking across borders, and seeking work in foreign countries.
9. 
So yes, if you bring in thousands of young men, that demographic will naturally show up more in crime stats—even if their behavior is no different from native-born youth.
But here’s where it gets even more interesting.
When researchers adjust for age and gender, the difference disappears.
A Syrian, North African, or Chinese immigrant commits crime at the same rate as a white European of the same age.
In fact, in many studies (including from Stanford and the Public Policy Institute of California), immigrants are actually less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens of similar demographic profiles.
So when right-wing pundits show you a scary chart without age or gender context, remember this:
They’re not sharing the truth.
They’re selling fear.
Crime is not an immigrant problem.
 It’s a young male problem—everywhere, across all ethnicities and countries.
And here’s the good news:
Crime is falling.
 Even among the most “at-risk” demographics.
 Humanity is evolving.
But if someone’s trying to win your vote with fear, they’re not going to tell you that.

The Culture Gap
Now, there’s another debate I often hear:
“But can immigrants, especially those from Muslim countries, actually assimilate into Europe?”
Ah.
That’s a more interesting question. 
The answer is: Absolutely yes.
When I hang out with my friends in Europe, they come from an eclectic and diverse bunch—Brits, Swedes, Italians, Indians, Americans, Canadians, Colombians, Egyptians, Emiratis.
And one thing I’ve noticed?
Almost all of us have parents who were deeply steeped in their original cultures.
But among our generation—those of us in our 30s and 40s—our values are remarkably similar.
Sure, we may vote for opposite political parties, but our core values?
We believe in women’s rights. In fairness. In democracy. In self-expression. In dignity.
But don’t take my word for it. There’s a scale that measures this.
In his book Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker discusses something called the Enlightenment Values Scale—which measures cultural attitudes toward democracy, equality, free speech, anti-corruption, women’s rights, and more.
What does the data say?
Enlightenment values are rising across the entire world.
Especially in the Islamic world. Especially in Africa.
Yes, these regions still have lower average Enlightenment scores than Europe or East Asia.
But they are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth.
According to the data, the average young person in the Islamic world today holds values equivalent to the average young European in the 1980s. (see the chart below)
You know what that means?
We’re talking about a two-generation gap.
That’s it. Two generations.
In fact, today’s 18-year-old in the Muslim world likely has more in common with a European 18-year-old than that European 18-year-old has with his own grandparents.
So if we want to claim that bringing in young immigrants from Muslim countries is somehow bringing in people who will “hijack” European culture—then based on the actual data, we might as well kick out our grandparents, too.
Because the gap isn’t between civilizations.
It’s between generations.
We are becoming more alike as a species.
Thanks to globalization, the internet, education, and shared media.
We are converging—not diverging.
And this new generation—the one crossing borders, dreaming bigger, seeking safety, opportunity, connection—they are not a threat.
They are the future.

Why Right-Wing Politicians Push the Fear Narrative
Because it works.
Because when it comes to actual governance, they underperform. 
VASTLY.
So they rely on outrage. Fear. Division.
Let’s look at the numbers—over the last 30+ years of U.S. leadership. 
Since 1990 the USA has had:
3 Republican Administrations: George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Donald Trump
3 Democratic Administrations: Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden
Now lets compare their performance on indicators of wealth, business and economy. 
Before I go into the numbers. Who do you think performs better?
Pause a moment and guess…..
When I surveyed my audience over 45% said Republicans. At an entrepreneurship meeting recently in the USA, 90% said Republicans. 
Yet the real data shows that Democrats outperform in almost every major category. 
- GDP Growth: Democrats averaged 3.46% growth; Republicans 2.4%.
- 
- GDP Per Capita: Higher growth under Democrats in every decade.
- 
- Job Creation: Democrats created 87.8 million jobs. Republicans: 31.9 million.
- 
- Unemployment Rate: Lower under Democrats—5.4% vs 6.2%.
- 
- Stock Market Performance (S&P 500): Democrats averaged 14.4% annual return. Republicans: 8.8%.
- 
- Deficit (as % of GDP): Republicans average defects ~2.68%, Democrats ~2.57%
- 
- Inflation: Lower under Democrats.
- 
- Infrastructure & Innovation: Democrats championed large-scale investment (CHIPS Act, Infrastructure Bill). Republicans leaned on deregulation and tax cuts.
Feel free to use your favourite AI to look up any of this data on your own. 
The conclusion?
Democrats govern better.
Republicans market fear better.
And they’ve learned how to weaponize the algorithm.
Now, to be clear — the comparison I’m making here is purely on business metrics.
Many of my entrepreneur friends—people I deeply respect—have told me they vote Republican because they prefer Republican business policy. 
When I shared this data with them, they were genuinely shocked. Most had been convinced that Republicans outperform Democrats on economic measures.
Now, if you vote Republican because you align with conservative values, your Christian faith, or prefer Republican tax policies—that’s absolutely okay. Vote Republican.
But let’s stop repeating the myth that Republicans are better for the economy.
When it comes to actual business performance, the data just doesn’t hold up.
And so distraction and division become the political game. 
The original Republican party (pre-Trump) had deep respect for immigrations. 
Reagan said “You can go to live in France, but you cannot become a Frenchman. You can go to live in Germany or Turkey or Japan, but you cannot become a German, a Turk, or Japanese. But anyone, from any corner of the Earth, can come to live in America and become an American.” (From Reagan’s remarks near the end of his presidency)
And Bush said “Our country is a country of laws, and we’ve got to enforce our laws. But we’re also a nation of immigrants … America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time.” (Address on Border Security and Immigration, May 2006)
But the current administration. I think many ex-Republican Presidents would be rolling in their graves. 

What You Can Do Next


Don’t believe the villainization of people who are struggling to feed their families and get a leg up in life. 

The next time you see an immigrant delivering your food…
The next time you’re served by a man with an accent…
The next time you step into a cab with a driver from a distant land…

Ask them their name.
Ask where they came from.
Ask why they came here.
Ask what they left behind.

Because they’re not your enemy.
They’re not here to take your job, your healthcare, or your safety.
They’re just trying to live.
Just like your grandparents once did.

And if we keep letting fear win—if we keep letting AI divide us—
then the greatest con of the 21st century will be complete:

The powerful will keep stealing from you.
And you’ll keep blaming the powerless.

It’s time to wake up.
To research.
To think.
To reconnect.
To choose leaders who build—not burn.

Because democracy will not survive another decade of algorithmic fear.
But it might—if we start choosing love over division, and truth over dopamine.

Pre: A few days ago, I got a voice note that totally blew me away — but more than that, it lit me up.

Blog Sub: 5 Lessons that Could Make You Triple Your Business in 60 Days 

The Founder Who Tripled Her Revenue in 60 Days — While Cutting Ad Spend by 50%
A few days ago, I got a voice note that totally blew me away — but more than that, it lit me up.
It was from a Mindvalley University attendee, an entrepreneur who had listened to just four hours of talks by me and Daniel Priestley during Entrepreneurship Day in Amsterdam.
She told me she’d written down 10 different ideas from those sessions — but then she did something that most people don’t do.
She gave herself 60 days to implement them.
The result?
 👉 Her company’s revenue TRIPLED.
 👉 Her ad spend dropped by half.
 👉 And in a single week, she got more website traffic than the previous three months combined.
When I heard this, I was absolutely thrilled. 
Because this wasn’t a beginner entrepreneur just starting out.
This was Nora Cavani, a powerhouse who was voted Female Founder of the Year at Web Summit 2024 — one of Europe’s top honors for entrepreneurs.
This woman already knew her stuff.
 And yet, the insights she picked up at Mindvalley University still transformed her business in ways that surprised even her.
So, what exactly did Nora do?
I asked her to go deep — to walk me through everything she implemented — because I believe her story can add massive value to you, especially if you’re building or scaling a business right now.
This isn’t theory.
This is what happens when real founders take bold ideas and apply them with precision.
For some of you, what you’re about to read might just change the trajectory of your business.
Because if this framework can help the Female Founder of the Year in Europe tripled her business in 60 days…
Imagine what it can do for you.

First off, the learning from Nora happened during Mindvalley U’s Entrepreneurship day. I was the main speaker alongside Daniel Priestly who is the #1 guest on Stephen Bartlett’s Diary of a CEO podcast - one of the top podcasts in the world. 

And his mind is gorgeous. He’s scaled seven companies to $100M+ in revenue. He’s now the main teacher in our new Entrepreneurship Mastery Degree along with me. 



So what did Nora learn from Daniel and me? Here are the 5 big things (feel free to copy).

Lesson 1: Master the Power of Webinars
When I was on stage at Mindvalley University, I shared how I’ve sold over $400 million worth of products through webinars — and I revealed the exact principles behind why they work.
A great webinar isn’t about pitching.
 It’s about educating.
 When people learn something that changes how they see the world, they don’t need to be sold — they buy.
That’s what Nora understood.
Her company, Alba Health, helps parents identify and address gut microbiome imbalances in children — a new and fast-growing field in health.
 But here’s the challenge: when a parent first hears “We test your child’s poop to help them be healthier,” the natural reaction is… Wait, what?
That’s where the power of education comes in.
A well-designed webinar — usually around 60 to 90 minutes long — gives you time to take your audience on a journey:

 1️⃣ Start with the problem they didn’t know they had.
 2️⃣ Educate them with science, stories, and empathy.
 3️⃣ Then introduce your solution as the natural next step.
Nora built her webinar around this structure.
 She began by teaching parents something most of them had never been told before:
 that the balance of bacteria in a child’s gut can directly impact not just their digestion — but their immune system, emotional regulation, and even neurological development.
Once parents understood that, the idea of testing gut bacteria stopped sounding strange — and started sounding essential.
Only then did Nora introduce Alba Health’s Gut Microbiome Test for Kids and explain how it works: parents order a simple at-home test, send in a small sample, and receive a detailed personalized report about their child’s microbiome, with guidance on how to restore balance through nutrition and supplements.
The result? Parents didn’t feel they were being sold a product.
 They felt they were being empowered with knowledge.
That’s the secret of a powerful webinar.
 It shifts your role from “seller” to “teacher.”
 And when people trust you as a teacher, they’ll follow you as a customer.

Lesson 2: Never Ignore the Goldmine of Email Marketing
During my talk at Mindvalley University — and again at our recent Entrepreneurship Summit — I showed the audience a screenshot of the very first Mindvalley website.
It’s not pretty.
 In fact, it looked like something that escaped the early 2000s. Because it did.
I built it in 2003 using Microsoft FrontPage — and if you’ve never heard of that software, count yourself lucky.
But hidden inside that painfully old website was a tiny breakthrough that changed my business forever.
If you look at the image below, you’ll see a small box circled on the right-hand side.
 That little box didn’t sell a product.



 It offered something free: a nine-part email series — a short book I’d written called The Unlimited You.
Now here’s what made it work.
Instead of just trying to sell Mindvalley’s top product at the time — the Silva Ultramind Home Study Course — I decided to teach first.
Each email was a bite-sized lesson on meditation, creative visualization, altered states, and unlocking human potential.
 Every day for nine days, subscribers received one new lesson.
And at the end of each email, there was a simple line:
“P.S. If you enjoyed this lesson, we go deeper in the Silva Ultramind Home Study Course — and you can get $20 off here.”
That’s it.
 No hype. No pushy sales copy. Just consistent, valuable education.
When I first launched that campaign, I was terrified it would hurt sales.
 I thought, “If I give away all this free knowledge, who’s going to buy the actual course?”
But the opposite happened.
The free series exploded. It was downloaded over a million times, and our product sales went up 96% overnight.
That tiny autoresponder sequence became one of the foundations of Mindvalley’s early growth.
And it worked because it did one thing most entrepreneurs forget to do — it built trust before selling.
Nora applied the same strategy. 
It worked like magic.

Lesson 3: Offer Value Before You Sell
One of the most powerful ideas shared at Mindvalley University came from my friend and co-teacher Daniel Priestley.
He said something that completely reframed how many entrepreneurs in the room thought about sales:
“Don’t try to sell your product.
 Sometimes what you need to sell first is a free assessment that helps your customer discover why they need your product.”
That single insight hit Nora like a lightning bolt.
Up to that point, her company, Alba Health, had been selling its gut-microbiome test for kids directly from its homepage.
 Parents could buy the test — but they didn’t always understand why they needed it.
So Nora tried Daniel’s approach.
She redesigned her website and added a free assessment that allowed parents to answer a few simple questions about their child’s health, energy, mood, and diet.

 Within minutes, the quiz generated a personalized health insight and gently suggested the next step:  to confirm the results through Alba Health’s microbiome test.
No hard sell. No “Buy now” buttons flashing red.
 Just genuine curiosity and service.
And it worked.


Almost overnight, Nora began receiving hundreds of new leads every day.
 But more importantly, she started building a community — parents who felt seen, understood, and guided before being sold to.
That quiz didn’t just generate sales.
 It built trust.
 And trust, in business, is the rarest currency of all.
Takeaway:
 Serve first.
 Sell later.
 Trust always.
Lesson 4: Let AI Do the Heavy Lifting
One part of my presentation that really lit up the room — and Nora especially — was when I showed how Mindvalley now runs with AI employees.
Not assistants. Not tools. Actual AI employees.
Each one is designed for a specialized purpose —
 an AI for email marketing,
 an AI for copywriting,
 an AI for YouTube script direction,
 and even AIs that analyze performance data and make creative recommendations.
These aren’t experiments. They’re team members.
 And they’ve transformed how we work.
Today, what used to take me five days now takes just one.
 We’ve eliminated 60–70% of the manual work that once slowed our teams down — and unlocked time for creativity, leadership, and innovation.
This is why I say that Entrepreneurship Mastery isn’t just for entrepreneurs — it’s for exponential entrepreneurs.
Yes, you’ll learn traditional business growth systems — webinars, email funnels, offers — but you’ll also learn how to deploy AI into every step of those systems.

Because the future of entrepreneurship isn’t about working harder.
 It’s about building smarter.
Nora took that idea and ran with it.
She went back to her company, Alba Health, and built her own AI employees — one for writing product descriptions, another for marketing content, another for customer communications.
Takeaway:
 AI doesn’t replace your creativity.
 It amplifies it — freeing you to lead, innovate, and grow exponentially.
Lesson 5: Start Building a Movement
This, to me, is the pinnacle of entrepreneurship — and it was the biggest shift Nora made.
In my talk at Mindvalley University, I shared why movements matter more than companies.
A company sells a product.
 A movement sells a belief.
When people buy a product, they might use it once.
 When they join a movement, they carry it into their identity.
That’s what Nora realized.
A few weeks after Mindvalley University, she was preparing for a breakfast event in London — a gathering of journalists, influencers, and partners. She was about to give a talk about her company, Alba Health, and its groundbreaking gut microbiome testing for children.
But while she was on the way there, she flipped through her notes from my talk.
 One line caught her attention:
“Build bigger than yourself. Don’t build a product. Build a movement.”
She stopped.
 Fifteen minutes before going on stage, she opened ChatGPT on her phone and restructured her entire presentation.
When she took the mic, she began with this:
“This isn’t a product presentation. This is a movement. And every one of you here has been handpicked because you can help us lead it.”
Her marketing manager froze — no one knew what was coming next.
But when the talk ended, every journalist and influencer in the room came up to her asking, “How can I contribute to this?”
The following week, her brand was everywhere — magazines, podcasts, social media.
 Her story went viral.
In just one week, her website saw more traffic than the previous three months combined.
 Sales skyrocketed.
 And her team was working late nights, even packaging orders until 11 p.m., just to keep up.
But here’s the beauty:
 Because she had already implemented Daniel’s free assessment funnel, my email sequence model, and her new AI systems — the surge didn’t break her business.
 It scaled it.
That’s the power of building a movement.
 When you stand for something bigger than your product, the world rushes in to help you build it.
The Closing: The 5 Steps That Tripled Nora’s Business

I Had Social Fright.
By Vishen Lakhiani

Hey [First Name], 
Ten years ago in May of 2015, I posted a short video on Facebook.
It looked like an innocent little clip — me standing outside Steve Jobs’ house, talking to my son:
“Hey Hayden, check it out. This is where Steve Jobs lived…”
But here’s the truth.
That video wasn’t really for Hayden. It was for you.

I desperately wanted to speak to the world — to share ideas, reflections, and meaning — but I was terrified of being judged.
So I hid behind the line: “Hey Hayden, check this out.”
It was my psychological armor.
By pretending I was just talking to my kid, I could trick myself into speaking without the fear of criticism. I could tell myself, “No one’s judging me. I’m just being a dad sharing something cool.”
But the truth is — I was being a coward.
The Moment of Fear
If you watch that old video, something interesting happens.
Within the first ten seconds, I look awkward. My body tenses up.
A friend was holding the camera, and I couldn’t take it.
I snatched the camera from him and turned it toward Steve Jobs’ house — so the focus was no longer on me.
I couldn’t even bear to be seen.
Watch the 58 second video here on Facebook and note how awkward I look.
It wasn’t stage fright. It was social fright — the fear of being judged, of being misunderstood, of being laughed at.
And it’s funny — because I had spoken on stage before.
But the camera, that silent lens staring back at you — it felt like the whole world watching, waiting to comment.
That terrified me.
The Hidden Truth About Speaking
People think speaking is about mastering body language, pacing, and storytelling.
But the real battle isn’t technical — it’s emotional.
It’s the quiet, invisible panic that asks: 
 “Who am I to say this?”
 “What if they think I sound stupid?”
 “What if no one cares?”
That’s what stops most people from ever hitting record.
And here’s the irony,  we live in a world that rewards voices, not perfection.
The world doesn’t need more polished speakers. It needs more honest ones.
The Shift

Over the years, I learned something liberating: The only way to kill social fright is to stop performing and start expressing.
When you speak from your truth — when your words come from your own lived experience — people can’t really criticize you.
They can disagree, but they can’t deny your authenticity.
That’s why I now introduce you to the Mindvalley Speaking Academy by Eric Edmeades — this is about how to build authority not through confidence, but through realness.

Because authority isn’t about being louder. It’s about being more you.
When I look back at that video today, I smile.
It’s awkward. It’s unpolished. But it’s also sacred.

Because that was the moment I stopped hiding behind “Hey Hayden…”
and started saying, “Hey world — this is me.”
People think great speakers are born confident. They’re not.
They’re just people who’ve learned to stop performing and start expressing.
When you speak from your truth, your lived experience, your real story — you become bulletproof.
People can disagree, but they can’t discredit authenticity.
That’s what I’ve learned over the years: The power of your voice isn’t about being louder.
It’s about being realer.
An Invitation to Find Your Voice
If this resonates with you — if you’ve ever felt that same hesitation before hitting record, or worried what people might think — I want to invite you to something special.
This Thursday, I’ll be live with Eric Edmeades, the man who trained many of Mindvalley’s top speakers (and yes, he’s coached me too).
Eric is the lead trainer for Mindvalley Speaking Academy, a five-day, small-group immersion happening soon in Miami — limited to just 50 participants.
Tickets are $10,000 as it's highly personal, and it’s one of the most transformative programs we’ve ever created.
But this week’s free masterclass is your chance to get a glimpse of that training — and real, actionable tools to start unlocking your voice immediately.

[Claim your FREE spot]
For the first 45 minutes, Eric will teach some of his most powerful frameworks for confident, persuasive speaking.

Then, for the final segment, we’ll discuss what happens inside the Speaking Academy — and how it can help you demolish fear, sharpen your story, and own any stage. 
This last 45 mins is for those of you who want to join me and Eric in Miami. (I won’t be teaching it, Eric will be. But my son is enrolled in it, so I’ll be stopping by to mingle and hang with the attending students.)
Why This Matters
I’ve sent Mindvalley’s top authors, executives, and even close friends to train with Eric. 
Every single one of them came back transformed — not just as speakers, but as leaders.
If you’ve ever dreamed of being on stage, of speaking your truth without fear, of turning your message into something that moves people — this masterclass is for you.
Join us live this Thu Oct 23.
 (Only 29 spots left for the in-person Speaking Academy in Miami — this session will show you exactly what it’s about.)

Because the world doesn’t need more perfect speakers.
It needs you — unfiltered, unafraid, and unapologetically seen.
See you Thursday,

 — Vishen
P.S. I’d love to hear from you — what’s one message you’d love to one day share with the world? Head over to the blog version of this newsletter and leave a comment. I read every one.

Pre: A strange meditation that could unlock your creativity, intuition, and higher potential.


🌌 The Mysterious Art of Quantum Jumping
By Vishen Lakhiani
Have you ever woken up one morning and thought…
 “How do I actually use the theory of multiple universes to make my life more productive, abundant, and wildly creative?”
Well, I have.
 And I promise you — I wasn’t high, drunk, or on any form of psychedelics.
In this bizarre, beautiful, and slightly mind-warping newsletter, I want to share a story with you.
A story about alternate universes, a wild new mind-bending meditation protocol, and a mentor of mine called Burt Goldman who embodied the phrase 
“You’re never too old to reinvent yourself.”
It’s about Quantum Jumping — a visualization technique so strange, so ahead of its time, that when I first heard it, I thought,
“What the hell are you talking about, Burt?!”
And yet… it changed the trajectory of my career, and possibly my understanding of reality itself.
So… What Is Quantum Jumping, Really?
At its core, Quantum Jumping is a guided visualization practice.
It combines meditation, hypnosis, and visualization to help you access the alpha brainwave state — the mental frequency of creativity and intuition.
Once you’re in that state, you visualize a doorway to another universe and step through it.
On the other side, you meet an alternate you who has already achieved what you desire — perhaps a fitter you, a wealthier you, a more confident you.
 You observe them, interact with them, and eventually merge with them, bringing back their wisdom and energy.
Sounds fantastic? Maybe.
But modern physics — and even modern tech — are beginning to echo the same principles.
How do you understand Quantum Jumping - here’s an animated 6 minute video I created with Burt to explain the concept.

If you know my work, you know that I’ve been deeply influenced by José Silva, the creator of the Silva Method — the original mind-training system that taught millions to access altered states of consciousness for creativity, healing, and intuition.
I never had the chance to meet José. He passed away in 1999.
But I did meet his protégé — his top instructor in the world — a man named Burt Goldman.
Burt wasn’t just a Silva instructor.
He was a modern-day mystic, an artist, a storyteller, and a scientist of consciousness rolled into one.
Under Silva’s guidance, Burt became a master of mind control and manifestation.
But later, he would go on to create his own technique — something that fused deep meditation, quantum theory, and creative imagination into what sounded like a plot from a Marvel movie.
He called it Quantum Jumping.
(Though technically, I gave it that name — over lunch with him in 2008.)
When Burt and I launched Quantum Jumping to the world through Mindvalley, it became the biggest product launch in our company’s history.
Our first million-dollar program. 
It swept across the internet like wildfire, and to this day, it remains one of the most beloved courses ever published on Mindvalley.
Now, almost five years since Burt passed away, Quantum Jumping is still going strong.
And recently, as I was teaching a class for our Manifesting Mastery students, I revisited this technique — and realized it’s more relevant now than ever.
Because today, even Google’s head of quantum computing says that the only explanation for how quantum computers work… is the theory of multiple universes.

Think about that.
The very people building the next generation of computers are starting to sound like mystics.
The Wild, Wonderful Life of Burt Goldman
In my many conversations with Burt, he would tell me stories that sounded like they came out of a Netflix docuseries.
He told me about growing up in Los Angeles and learning to surf on an ironing board — because surfboards hadn’t been invented yet.

He told me about studying under Paramahansa Yogananda, and sitting in a car with the legendary yogi as he visualized a plot of barren land and manifested a temple on it — a story I’ll save for another newsletter.
He told me about working side by side with José Silva, teaching tens of thousands of people the art of entering altered states of mind.
When I became a Silva instructor myself, Burt was my mentor.
In his seventies, he was still experimenting, still innovating. 
Together, we helped him relaunch himself online as The American Monk, a digital meditation teacher before “digital meditation teachers” were even a thing.
But Burt wasn’t content teaching one thing.

He was also writing books (including The Silva Mind Control Method of Mental Dynamics), painting, composing music, building websites, and — my favorite — pioneering a brand new art form that landed him in the International Photography Hall of Fame.
I once asked him,
“Burt, if you could teach the world one thing… what would it be?”
He looked at me, eyes sparkling with mischief, and said:
“I’d teach people how to jump into alternate universes — and meet themselves.”
“Wait… What?” — My First Quantum Jump
At first, I thought he was joking.
Jump into alternate universes? Meet your doppelgänger?
Was Burt finally going senile?
But then he explained.
He told me that during deep meditation, he had learned to visualize a quantum door — a portal into another universe.
On the other side, he’d meet a version of himself who had already mastered the skill he wanted to learn — whether it was painting, photography, or business.
He’d observe this “alternate Burt,” absorb their mindset, and bring it back.
The result?
 At 80 years old, he taught himself painting.
 At 82, he learned photography — and within six months, his photos were featured in museums.
 He wrote, sang, coded, and created like a man half his age.
And so, I tried it.
I invited Burt to a Silva class I was teaching in Anaheim to demonstrate his method.
And what I experienced… I’ll never forget.
It was like my imagination had turned 3D.
Like meeting an infinite library of versions of myself — all whispering, “Here’s how you do it.”
Burt and I would then partner up and launch Quantum Jumping to the world in 2008. And in a moment I’m going to show you how to experience it. 
But I’d like to show you some proof first. 
🎥 The Day I Visited Burt’s Multiverse
This is a 2014 home video I made and edited myself while visiting Burt’s magical home in 2014.
I drove up to his home in Rancho Mirage, California, to film a short video.
That video — which you can now watch on Youtube Here— shows me walking through his gallery of hundreds of paintings and photos.

In the video you’ll notice the prolific amount of art and creations lying all across Burt’s home. 
Why Science Might Be Catching Up
1. Vadim Zeland’s Reality Transurfing
A Soviet quantum physicist named Vadim Zeland proposed a model called Reality Transurfing.
 He believed that all possible versions of your life exist simultaneously in the quantum field — like tracks on a record.
The version of you who’s a billionaire.
 The version of you who’s healed, fit, and vibrant.
 The version of you who’s living in total peace.
You don’t “create” these realities — you choose them.
But here’s the catch:
 When you care too much, when you obsess over your desire, you generate what Zeland calls excess potential — an energetic resistance that actually pushes your goal away.
The universe, seeking balance, introduces obstacles.
The harder you push, the more resistance you create.
Zeland’s solution?
He called it the No Big Deal approach.
You choose what you want, but you don’t cling to it.
You hold your desire lightly — like, “It’d be nice if I had it, but if not, that’s fine too.”
It’s the paradox of manifestation:
The moment you stop needing the thing, the thing starts needing you.
Quantum Jumping embodies this perfectly.
You visit the version of you who already has the result — no desperation, no longing. Just curiosity and merging.
You become the vibration of that reality, and life rearranges itself around you.
2. The Multiverse and Quantum Mechanics
In 1957, physicist Hugh Everett proposed the Many-Worlds Interpretation — that every decision spawns new universes.
 Each of us lives infinite versions of our lives across infinite realities.
Quantum Jumping isn’t saying you’re physically teleporting.
It’s saying you can mentally align with the version of yourself that already exists in another probability field.
It’s not teleportation — it’s resonation.
3. Quantum Computing & The Simulation Hypothesis
Quantum computers process information using particles that exist in multiple states at once — superposition.
 This allows them to explore countless outcomes simultaneously, then “collapse” into the optimal one.
Sound familiar?
 That’s exactly what your consciousness does when you visualize a goal.
Even Elon Musk believes reality works like this.
 He once said:
“There’s a one in billions chance that we’re living in base reality.”
Meaning: if civilizations can create realistic simulations, odds are we’re already inside one.
So what is Quantum Jumping, really?
It’s learning to hack the simulation.
To consciously select your reality upgrade — to “load” a new version of yourself from the infinite multiversal code.
Why It Works (Even If You Don’t Believe It)
Here’s the secret:
Quantum Jumping works because it trains your brain to accept new possibilities as real.
Your subconscious stops saying, “That’s impossible.”
 It starts saying, “That’s already me.”
And when that belief becomes embodied — when your nervous system accepts it — your actions, decisions, and opportunities shift.
You start sliding into that version of reality.
That’s the mechanism behind every miracle, every creative breakthrough, every overnight transformation.
Not magic — mental software upgrade.
Experience Quantum Jumping Yourself
The original Quantum Jumping course is now available on Mindvalley and was created by Burt Goldman – named and popularized by me and we recently added Quantum Jumping 1 and 2 (worth $500)  to Mindvalley membership.

Pre: This story starts with a man named Bob Proctor.

The Man Who Pushed Me Onto Stage (and Changed My Life)
In Loving Memory of Bob Proctor
There are a few people you meet in life who change your trajectory forever.
For me, one of those people was Bob Proctor.
If you’ve ever listened to The Secret or stumbled upon an old YouTube video of a white-haired gentleman talking about “paradigms” and the power of the subconscious mind — that’s Bob. 
He was one of the world’s most beloved teachers on prosperity consciousness. 
He spent over 60 years helping millions of people reprogram their thinking to unlock abundance, confidence, and self-worth.
But for me, Bob wasn’t just a teacher.
He was my first mentor.
The day Bob Proctor threw me to the wolves 🫣
Back in 2005, Bob came to Malaysia to give a seminar.
I was just a young entrepreneur — no fame, no followers, no stage experience.
Right before his talk, he turned to me and said,
“Vishen, I want you to introduce me.”
I froze.
I’d never spoken to an audience before.
But Bob just smiled that mischievous smile of his — the kind that said, “You’ll thank me later.”
So I walked on stage, palms sweating, voice shaking, heart trying to escape my chest…
And I absolutely butchered that introduction.
But that’s how Bob operated.
He had this uncanny way of pushing you into discomfort — not to watch you squirm, but because he knew that’s where your next level lived.
And I often wonder…
Where would I be today if Bob hadn’t given me that first uncomfortable push?
The day Bob walked into the Mindvalley office 💎
Fast forward to 2014. Bob visited the Mindvalley office in Kuala Lumpur.
He gave an unforgettable talk, filled with that trademark blend of wisdom and fire.
And then, just before he left, he said something I’ll never forget:
“I’d like to record a meditation for you.”

Bob Recording the Abundance Meditation  in our Office in 2014. 
So we found the quietest corner we could — a simple desk, my old iPhone 5 — and hit record.
That’s how The Abundance Meditation was born.
The audio wasn’t perfect (thank you, 2014 microphone quality 😅).
But what poured through Bob’s voice was pure magic.
We uploaded it to YouTube and later added it to the Mindvalley app.
Over the years, 4.2 million people listened to it. 
It became one of the most loved meditations in our library.

So, What is Abundance Meditation About ? 

Let’s unpack the Abundance Meditation and how it will help you, 
It’s not just about attracting a bigger bank balance. 
It’s about rewiring your mind to recognize the abundance that’s already here. 
Think of it as turning up the volume on the good stuff.
Bob Proctor’s work is all about mindset, and this meditation is a concentrated dose of that. 

It’s designed to help you:
1. Smash limiting beliefs: Those sneaky thoughts that tell you “not enough” or “not possible”? This meditation helps dismantle them.
2. 
3. Visualize abundance: You’ll be guided to create a vivid picture of your abundant life. This isn’t just daydreaming, it’s programming your subconscious.
4. Feel the feeling: The key isn’t just seeing it, but feeling the gratitude and joy of already having it. That’s what magnetizes it to you.
This meditation isn’t a magic wand, but it’s a powerful tool for shifting your perspective and opening yourself up to receive. 

Just like you’re expanding your consciousness and building that solid foundation to manifest your intentions into reality. 
The voice our community couldn’t let go of
Recently, our team decided to clean up the recording.
We used AI to remove the background fuzz and smooth the sound.
We thought we were doing a good thing.
But something surprising happened.
Our inbox filled with messages from the community:
“Please bring back the original version.”
 “We love hearing Bob’s real voice.”
And that’s when I realized something profound.
Perfection doesn’t always make things better.

Sometimes, it’s the imperfections that carry the soul.
A story that proves the power of practice
One of my favorite stories came from DJ Bliss, one of the Middle East’s top musicians.
During an interview, he told me he listened to Bob’s Abundance Meditation 100 days in a row.
What happened next was wild —
His career exploded.
He landed a spot on the world’s #1 reality show, Dubai Bling.
And he said, “That meditation changed my life.”
That’s the kind of magic Bob left behind.
A gift for you 🎁
I know Bob is smiling somewhere right now — seeing all of us still learning, growing, expanding.

Final thought 
Every time I hear Bob’s voice say,
“You were born rich,”
 I remember that day in 2005 when he shoved me onto that stage.

He was introducing me to my destiny.

Preheader: You don’t think your way to awakening. You need to feel it. Let’s go deeper.. 
This is The Age of Spiritual Embodiment



Spiritual knowledge expands your perspective.
It helps you connect with the Source — the Universe — your higher self.
But here’s the truth most seekers quietly feel:
Spirituality alone doesn’t always translate into action.
You can meditate, visualize, even glimpse the infinite —
 and still feel stuck in the same patterns of stress, fear, or resistance.
Why?
 Because spirituality understood is not the same as spirituality embodied.
The theories, the mysteries, the teachings — they open your mind to new truths.
But embodiment is what makes those truths real.
When wisdom descends from your head into your heart, your breath, your nervous system —
 your energy recalibrates.
 Your biology starts to mirror your consciousness.
 And suddenly, you’re not chasing purpose or peace —
 you’re radiating it.
This is the next stage of human evolution:
where spirituality stops being something you believe in, but will be something you become.
At Mindvalley, we’ve spent years exploring how to make spirituality not just mystical — but measurable.
What we’ve discovered is profound:
When the body remembers what the soul has always known,
That's when transformation becomes permanent.
That's the embodiment.  And that’s what this new era of awakening is all about.
Now let’s go deeper, 
Why “Embodiment” Is the Missing Link in Most Spiritual Practice
Modern science is finally catching up to what mystics have known for centuries.
 The body isn’t separate from consciousness. It’s an instrument of it.
Neuroscience calls this interoception — the ability to sense your inner world.
 When you’re in tune with your heartbeat, breath, and fascia, your brain creates a state of coherence — the measurable harmony between mind and body.
Dr. Tara Swart, MIT neuroscientist and one of the speakers at this year’s Mindvalley Spiritual Summit, calls this “embodied intelligence.”
 It’s where intuition, logic, and energy converge into one seamless flow.
In the same way that the heart emits an electromagnetic field measurable up to three feet away, your entire nervous system radiates your state of being.
When that system is aligned — when you’ve embodied your truth — the world around you starts to align too.
This is why true awakening can’t just live in your mind.
It has to move through your body.
The Next Level of Awakening: Embodied Spirituality

At the Mindvalley Spiritual Summit 2025 (happening Nov 22-23), we’re moving beyond spiritual information — into spiritual integration.
Because embodiment isn’t about chasing new experiences.  It’s about anchoring your highest frequency in every breath, movement, and moment.
In our efforts to bring the best to you, we have recently added cutting edge spiritual embodiment modalities that you can experience. 
Here’s how we’re doing it:
Qi Gong & Energy Flow — Shi Heng Yi

Led by the 35th-generation Shaolin Master, Shi Heng Yi, this practice connects movement, breath, and consciousness into one seamless current.
He teaches that the body is the bridge between the mind and the universe — and when your Qi flows freely, so does your life.
In clinical research across 12 trials, Qi Gong has been shown to significantly reduce depression and anxiety, proving that ancient movement rituals regulate modern stress biology.
Learn from Shi Heng Yi
Somatic Healing & Trauma Release — Dr. Peter Levine

Dr. Peter Levine — the creator of Somatic Experiencing® — revolutionized how the world understands trauma.
 His work shows that emotional pain doesn’t just live in the mind; it’s stored as contraction in the body.
In randomized trials, Somatic Experiencing led to large reductions in PTSD and depression, lasting long after treatment.
 At the Summit, Peter will guide you in unlocking the body’s innate wisdom — releasing what’s held you back, one breath at a time.
Learn how to release the trauma stored in your body.
The Way of Presence — Sensei Zen Takai (The Zen Samurai)

Back by popular demand from Mindvalley University, Zen Takai — known as The Zen Samurai — returns to teach presence through embodied precision.
A 16th-generation martial arts master, his sessions are not about combat, but consciousness.
 Through standing meditation, focused breath, and subtle movement, he teaches how stillness in motion becomes your ultimate spiritual discipline.
Even short martial-style mindfulness programs have been shown to improve cognitive performance and emotional balance in just two months — because discipline of the body leads to discipline of the mind.
Learn the art of stillness from The Zen Samurai.
Neuroscience of Embodied Manifestation — Dr. Tara Swart

Manifestation isn’t just spiritual — it’s neurochemical.
Gratitude, focus, and emotional regulation literally reshape the brain’s circuitry.
Studies show that people who keep gratitude journals for a few weeks are 25% happier, sleep better, and follow through on their goals more consistently.
Another three-week brain-imaging study found that gratitude practices increased reward sensitivity in the brain — proof that consistent embodied emotion rewires your reality.
At the Summit, Dr. Swart will reveal how to use this science to align your brain with the vibration of abundance and intuition — not as theory, but as lived biology.
Learn to scientifically tap into your abundance & intuition.
We have some of community’s most-loved spiritual teachers who are the pioneers of spiritual embodiment: 
Kundalini Awakening — Dawn Hoang

Kundalini is not a mystical abstraction; it’s a physiological awakening of life force through the spine and nervous system.
In clinical studies, Kundalini Yoga has reduced PTSD symptoms and anxiety, improved memory, and elevated mood — even in older adults.
Dawn Hoang’s approach integrates breath, sound, and somatic release into a trauma-informed activation that allows this energy to rise safely and powerfully.
You’ll experience a live, collective Kundalini activation — with hundreds moving in coherence, amplifying the field exponentially.
Experience a collective Kundalini activation.
Environmental Energy Clearing — Marie Diamond

Your outer environment mirrors your inner energy.
In one fascinating study, hospital rooms designed using Feng Shui principles reduced patient anxiety and improved comfort levels compared to standard rooms.
Marie Diamond — the only European teacher featured in The Secret — will guide you to harmonize your space with your spirit, turning your home into a manifestation vortex.
Learn deep insights to build an environment around you that helps you thrive.
Identity-Level Manifestation — Regan Hillyer

Transformation becomes effortless when it aligns with your identity.
Research shows that when people align actions with their active identity, effort and persistence increase automatically.
Meta-analyses across 15,000+ participants prove that combining clear mental intention with embodied visualization dramatically boosts success outcomes.
Regan’s session takes you beyond vision boards into identity re-coding — helping you embody the frequency of your highest self until it becomes your default reality.
Tune into advanced manifestation practices.
The Science of Embodied Awakening
When the above modalities of spiritual embodiment converge — with your movement, breath, sound, awareness — something measurable happens.
Your brain waves synchronize into calm alpha and theta states.
The vagus nerve triggers the parasympathetic system, calming your body’s stress response.
The fascia network begins transmitting energy instead of storing tension.
And your electromagnetic field (yes, it can be measured) expands in strength and coherence.
In other words: You connect & embody with a higher version of yourself. 
This is why this experience is the beginning of actually living your spiritual purpose.

A Final Thought
You’ve studied the maps.
You’ve read the books.
You’ve practiced the meditations.
Now it’s time to become the master. Because embodiment is where awakening stops being an idea — and starts becoming your frequency.
See you at the Summit,

 — Vishen

Unity: The Next Evolution Of Consciousness

By Vishen Lakhiani 

Two weeks ago, I landed in Miami.

I didn’t expect to be greeted by two FBI agents with the politeness of yoga instructors and the curiosity of philosophers… but here we are.

I’ve recorded what happened and posted it to the world - this video you’re about to see, got 1.3 million views on Instagram. 
 
Watch The Video Here

Here’s what happened, 

The FBI agents asked me about my recent travels — Brazil, Istanbul, Dubai.

Brazil?
Rock in Rio.

Istanbul?
Gates of Agartha Festival. Satori was playing; the only thing I was conspiring with was great music.

Dubai?
Well, Dubai is the global center of capitalism and one of the most innovative cities in the world (Ofcourse i go there.)

Then came the question:

“Have you consorted with any politicians?”

I said yes — last year I was at a dinner in Mar-a-Lago.
They nodded, handed back my passport, and welcomed me to the U.S.

No drama. No hostility. The agents were doing their job.

The real issue isn’t the FBI.

The real issue is the culture of fear America has fallen into.



Fear: The Last Refuge of Leaders With No Vision

Tourism to the U.S. is down 15%.
International students down 17%.
Immigration demonized.
The world’s most iconic “nation of immigrants” now treats newcomers like threats.

Why?

Because fear is the cheapest political drug.

Pushing the fear button is the last refuge of leaders who have no talent, no vision, and no solutions.

And nowhere is this more obvious than the stories being sold to Americans daily.



The Night at Mar-a-Lago That Explained Everything

I was invited to Mar-a-Lago for a dinner for an incoming Republican senator. 
. 
I was truly honored and grateful for the invite. 
And I want to say that the people there were genuinely nice to me. 

While we disagreed on policy, we got along as friends. 

But I'd like to share with you some of the things I heard that day in March of 2024.


I sat next to a Christian woman who believed abortion should be banned nationwide.
I disagreed — but I respected her conviction.

Then a senator told me:

“There are 300,000 Chinese migrants at the southern border waiting to be activated by China.”

I asked for evidence.
He admitted he heard it as a rumor.

Fair enough.

Another person told me that there are 2 million potential terrorists in America after what happened in Israel. 
Of course, there was no supporting evidence for this.

Now let me tell you what I did not hear, 

No one was talking about:

	•	Healthcare
	•	the Debt crisis
	•	Cost of living
	•	Education
	•	Economic mobility

There were no ideas. No policies. No strategies.
Just fear. 

And yet fear won votes. Millions of them.


But Let’s Look at the Hard Proof: Fear is bad politics and bad for business. 

Now, let’s step away from fear, rumor, and political superstition…
and look at actual numbers.

Because when you examine the last seven decades of U.S. economic performance,
a very uncomfortable truth emerges:

The U.S. economy performs dramatically better under Democrats than Republicans.

Take these five core indicators that economists use to measure national performance:

1️⃣ Real GDP Growth
Since World War II, America’s GDP has grown at about 4.3% under Democratic presidents versus 2.5% under Republicans.

2️⃣ Job Creation
Job growth averages 2.6% per year under Democrats and 1.1% under Republicans — tens of millions of additional jobs.

3️⃣ Unemployment
Under Democrats, unemployment usually falls by about 0.8 percentage points.
Under Republicans, it typically rises by about 1.1 points.

4️⃣ Stock Market Performance
The S&P 500 returns roughly 8.3% per year under Democrats and only 2.7% under Republicans.
If you invested based on party alone, you’d retire in a hammock on a beach.

5️⃣ Recessions
Ten of the last eleven recessions began under Republican presidents.
That’s not ideology. That’s math.

You can fact-check them by asking AI in regards to what I'm talking about. Feel free to research them. 

Most American entrepreneur friends of mine still believe the myth that when Republicans are in power, business is better. 

That myth is the exact opposite of actual facts and data as stated above. 

Democrats do better and business. And they do so without having to blame immigrants and others. 

Republicans do the opposite.



And Here’s Where MAGA Makes It Even Worse

It’s not just that Republican economic myths don’t hold up. Trump’s current strategy is actively harming America’s economy and global brand.

Trump’s vilification of immigrants — and the violent ICE raids flooding Instagram and TikTok — are already hitting the U.S. economy like a slow-motion avalanche.

Obama deported 3M people. But he did it without harming America's image.

Here’s what we’re seeing:

1. Tourism to America has fallen by roughly 15%: That’s billions of dollars lost annually because visitors no longer feel welcome — or safe.

1. Foreign graduate student applications have dropped by about 17%.
2. This is catastrophic.These students often stay, innovate, start companies, and build the industries of tomorrow. They’re the future builders of Silicon Valley, healthcare breakthroughs, AI labs, and biotech.

1. Forty-four percent of American unicorn companies were created by immigrants.
2. Nearly half of the most valuable companies in America exist because of immigrant founders.

1. Every ICE raid you see on Instagram isn’t just traumatizing undocumented families —
2. It is damaging America’s global brand, driving talent away, shrinking innovation, and weakening long-term competitiveness.

Fearmongering may get votes. But it is a horrible economic strategy. You cannot build a future-ready nation by scaring away the very people who create the future.

If we agree that diversity is beneficial, that unity matters, that racism is something that belongs in the garbage bin of history. 

When we stop falling for these myths, and we stop allowing politicians to use them as weapons. 

I created the video to dismantle many of these myths.

Darwin & the Diffusion of Sympathy

Now let’s  zoom out to science.

Charles Darwin wrote:

“As man advances in civilization, he extends his sympathies to all members of the nation, and then to all nations.”

He called this the diffusion of sympathy —
the expansion of empathy.

This is evolution.
This is progress.
This is how civilizations rise.

Shrinking empathy?
That’s regression.

Fear shrinks empathy.
Unity expands it.



The Spiritual Perspective: Why Unity Matters The Most Right Now

Neale Donald Walsch wrote:

“The highest virtue of highly evolved beings is unity.”

And another:

“In advanced civilizations, unity is not a dream — it is their natural state.”

This is the future of humanity. 

From egocentric to ethnocentric to world-centric to cosmocentric.

And that’s the work we’re doing at Mindvalley.



The Mindvalley Spiritual Summit: A Leap Beyond Fear



Our upcoming Spiritual Summit is a gathering of world’s 9 top spiritual teachers committed to unity consciousness:

Regan Hillyer (#1 Manifestation Coach)  | Lee Holden (Medical Qi Gong Master) | Marie Diamond (Feng Shui Master) | Dawn Hong (Kundalini Master)  | Shi Heng Yi (35th generation Shaolin Master) | Dr. Peter Levine (Psychologist & Founder of Somatic Experiencing®)  | Sensei Zen Takai (16-generation Samurai)  | Dr. Tara Schwartz (Neuroscientist), and myself. 

[Get your spot at  Spiritual Summit here]
Happening this weekend Nov 22-23 

I'll talk about a powerful and interesting idea by Ken Wilber (the world's most cited academic) – called Stages and States, which helps you understand how we can bring unity consciousness, within ourselves and the world. We will go deeper into why unity is important for the progression of humanity. 

This isn’t just an event. It’s an energetic consciousness activation.

If fear is the virus,unity is the medicine.

Darwin knew this.
Walsch knew this.
Wilber mapped it.
And the world desperately needs to remember it.

See you at the summit, 

P.S. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this.

Unity, fear, immigration, evolution — what part of this message resonated with you most?
Share it in the comments on the blog version. I’ll be reading every single one.

Vote for pragmatism. Vote for unity. Vote for evolution.

Humanity is ready for its next leap.

With love,

Vishen

Pre: A funny thing happens when you’ve spent two decades studying human transformation. (one best deal for you inside)

The Tiny Yogurt Habit That Shifted Everything (And How One Habit Can Change Your Entire Life)
A funny thing happens when you’ve spent two decades studying human transformation: You realize that most people think they need a life overhaul…
when what they really need is a 2-degree shift.
A tiny habit.
A micro-adjustment.
A new pattern so small it almost feels insignificant.
But these tiny shifts?
They don’t stay tiny.
They cascade.
They compound.
They quietly reroute your destiny.
This is an article about my strange kitchen habits. But for many of you it might lead to a life changing shift. 

This is the great secret behind the Six Phase Meditation, Habit of Ferocity, and every Quest inside Mindvalley.

Your life doesn’t transform through force.
It transforms through micro-systems—small actions that repeat until your future becomes inevitable.
And recently, my body reminded me of this truth in a very real way.
The Wake-Up Call in My Waistline
In April this year, I spent seven beautiful weeks traveling between Malaysia and the United States.
Time with family.
Amazing conversations.
New experiences.
And, of course… extraordinary food. 
But while my spirit was expanding, something else was expanding too.
After two weeks in Malaysia and five weeks in the U.S., I had added…
seven centimeters to my waistline.
Seven centimeters.
On a 49-year-old man who uses tech, meditation, biohacking, and longevity science to stay optimized.
By the time I returned to Europe in June, half my pants were negotiating early retirement packages.
My conclusion?
“It must be American food.
 And Malaysian food.
 And maybe my relationship with curry laksa.”
And so—being the AI geek that I am—I decided to test a theory:
If my body changed this fast, maybe I was missing something my brain couldn’t see…
but an AI could.
So I built an AI for myself.
 A private little food-logging companion that analyzed everything I ate.
 Every meal is photographed.
 Every nutrient tracked.
 Every pattern is analyzed.
And on Day 5, the AI said something unexpected:
“I’m noticing that you are severely deficient in fiber.”
It explained that 95% of men don’t get enough fiber.
That fiber affects everything: gut health, weight loss, emotional stability, blood sugar, immunity, skin, sleep, even brain performance.
And that both Malaysian and American cuisines are notoriously low in fiber.
Then it suggested a tiny change:
“Add yogurt with blueberries, banana, chia seeds, and psyllium husk to your breakfast.”
Just once a day. Just one habit.
I was skeptical.
I eat low-carb.
A banana? Yogurt? Wasn’t that going to blow up my macros?
But I tried it anyway.
And then something shocking happened:
I started losing one centimeter of waistline per week.
In six weeks, my waist was back to where it was before my trip.
My pants forgave me.
I forgave America.
The benefits didn’t stop there:
- My skin looked better
- My hair got healthier
- My energy and mood lifted
- My focus sharpened
- My workouts improved
- My sleep deepened
From one tiny habit. One three-minute change. One micro-shift that changed everything.
As proof this is my waist line chart from my Apple Health kit. Notice the big spike? Then the big drop? The drop occurred when I started this habit. 



Notice the spike. And then the drop? This is now my Fibre kit in my kitchen. 


But this is more than just about the glories of Yogurt. It’s about the power of habits.
Tiny Habits Aren’t Just Physical…
They Change Your Identity
There’s another powerful force working behind the scenes when you install a new habit—
 and this is where the real magic happens.
Every time you take on a healthy habit, you’re not just changing your behavior.
 You’re upgrading your self-identity.
Psychologists call this the Identity Shift Effect: Every action you take becomes a vote for the person you believe yourself to be.
Start adding fiber daily and suddenly…
You’re no longer someone who “tries to be healthy.”
 You’re someone who is healthy.
You’re no longer reacting to circumstance.
 You’re proving to your brain:
“I am the kind of person who takes action for my own wellbeing.”
This is one of the greatest transformations a human being can experience—
 the shift from victim-of-reality to co-creator-of-reality.
And science supports this beautifully.
Study #1 – Harvard’s “Small-Wins Effect”
Research from Harvard Business School shows that even tiny wins—small progress on goals—create a powerful neurochemical cascade of dopamine and motivation.
This becomes a self-reinforcing loop:
- You take one small positive action
- Your brain rewards you
- That reward gives you the motivation to take the next action
- And that momentum becomes a chain reaction
A spoon of chia seeds. A 10-second breath. One stretch. One glass of water.
Each one is a “small win” that rewires your biology for progress.
Study #2 – Stanford’s BJ Fogg and the Habit Cascade
Stanford behavioral scientist BJ Fogg discovered this in his groundbreaking “Tiny Habits” research:
Small habits don’t stay small.
They expand horizontally and vertically.
One tiny habit creates a ripple that triggers the next…and the next…and the next.
This is called the Habit Cascade.
My yogurt habit led to:
- More veggies
- A fiber-rich fridge
- Daily veggie shakes
- Better workouts
- More mental clarity
- A return to my ideal waistline
- Better energy and sleep
- Better creativity and productivity
- 
One habit → many upgrades.
Because once your identity shifts, your behavior follows.
Once your behavior shifts, your environment follows.
Once your environment shifts, your future expands.
This is the real secret.
The Real Magic of Tiny Habits
They are doable.
 Repeatable.
 Identity-shifting.
 Momentum-creating.
 And they create exponential results over time.
And this is exactly why Mindvalley was designed the way it is.

The Lie You’ve Been Sold About Your Neighbor (And Why It’s Making Someone Else Rich)

We've All Been Played
A Letter to the People of America — and to Anyone Who Loves Them
I need to tell you about something that's been breaking my heart.
Last summer, I took my kids, Hayden and Eve, on a two-week road trip across the heart of America. From South Dakota to Wyoming to Montana.
We fired guns at a range outside Cody. We camped in Yellowstone under stars so bright it felt like the sky was showing off. We sat at the famous Cody Rodeo while families around us waved American flags with a pride that made my chest tight with emotion.
The people we met were extraordinary.
At a local diner, the waitress gave us the warmest service and the best pie I’ve had in years. At the hotels we stayed in, we were treated with overwhelming kindness and sincerity.


Wyoming July 2025 with the kids. 
I am not an American citizen. I was born in Malaysia. I run Mindvalley, an American company. But I've spent nearly three decades traveling across your country — from my college years in Michigan to speaking events in Florida; from tech conferences in San Francisco to quiet conversations in Ohio diners.
And here is what I know to be true:
The American people are not the problem.
The warmth I felt in Wyoming, I have felt in every corner of this nation. In so-called ""red"" America and so-called ""blue"" America. Among people who voted for Trump and people who voted for Biden. Among ranchers and professors, veterans and artists, churchgoers and skeptics.
The goodness is everywhere.
So why does it feel like you are at war with each other?
The Rodeo Speech That Changed Something in Me
At the Cody Rodeo, the announcer stepped into the ring and gave a speech called ""Why We Stand.""
He spoke of soldiers who never came home from Vietnam. From Iraq. From the beaches of Normandy. He spoke of sacrifice, of freedom, of a flag that represents something men and women were willing to die for.
The crowd went silent. Hats came off. Hands covered hearts.
And I thought: This is real. This love of country is real. This reverence is real.
These people are not hateful. These people are not ignorant. These people are not my enemies.
Then a second thought hit me hard:
Who the hell convinced Americans that they are enemies of each other?

I Was Manipulated Too

I need to confess something.
For years, I consumed media that painted a certain picture of Trump supporters. I read the tweets. I watched the clips. I saw the worst moments replayed on loop until they seemed like the whole story.
I absorbed a caricature.
Then I went to Wyoming. And I met human beings.
They didn't match the cartoon I'd been sold. Not even close. These were people worried about the same things everyone worries about:
Can I afford to get sick?
Will my children have a better life than me?
Why does it feel like the whole system is rigged against regular folks?
These aren't Republican questions or Democratic questions. These are human questions. These are kitchen-table questions.
I realized I had allowed myself to see my fellow human beings as enemies — because it's easier to hate a cartoon than to sit with complexity.
If I was manipulated, I suspect I'm not the only one.
The Inclusion Paradox
There is a hard question I had to ask myself—a question raised by the philosopher Ken Wilber, whose course “Integral Life” is part of the Mindvalley curriculum.
He describes a strange paradox in our modern culture. We have a ""leading edge"" of society that prides itself on love, diversity, and inclusion. We fight for the environment. We fight for minorities. We fight for the oppressed.
But there is one group we often feel comfortable excluding.
Wilber calls this a ""performative contradiction."" How can we claim to be the movement of diversity if we look down on half the country as ""deplorables""?
We cannot claim to stand for ""inclusion"" if we hold contempt for diversity of thought.
If our tolerance stops the moment someone wears a red hat, it isn't tolerance. It is just another form of tribalism wearing a nicer outfit.
We have to be better than that. True inclusivity means holding space even for those we vehemently disagree with, understanding that their pain is just as real as ours.

The Machine That Profits From Your Division

Here's what I've come to believe.
There are forces that profit when Americans hate each other.
The equation is simple:
When you're angry, you click. When you click, someone makes money.
When you're afraid, you watch. When you watch, someone sells ads.
And when you are divided, you don't notice that your wages haven't kept pace with inflation while CEO pay has soared. You don't notice that healthcare bankrupts half a million families a year. You don't notice that the same corporations often fund both parties, ensuring they win no matter who is in the White House.
The platform owners know exactly what they’re doing.
A study from MIT found that falsehoods and outrage-driven content spread six times faster than the truth.
Internal Facebook files leaked in 2021 revealed that their algorithm privileged anger to such a degree that even Meta’s own engineers warned it was “ripping society apart.”
Ken Wilber calls this the ""Culture of Post-Truth.""
It creates a state of ""aperspectival madness""—where we lose our shared reality and retreat into warring tribes. When algorithms prioritize outrage over facts, truth vanishes. And when there is no truth, there is only power.
The division is not an accident. It is a business model.
And all of us — left and right, rural and urban, MAGA and progressive — we are the product being sold.
Then comes the second wave: The Bots.
A 2024 USC study analyzed the online traffic during recent political flashpoints. What they found was chilling.
Nearly half of the most viral, toxic conversations weren't coming from humans.
They were generated by bots. In some cases, bot activity spiked from 20% to 43% of the total conversation.
These weren't Americans. These were automated scripts originating from Russia, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Macedonia.
Think about that.
When you see a comment that makes your blood boil, when you rage at ""the other side""—half the time, you aren't fighting a fellow citizen. You are fighting a line of code from a server farm halfway across the world.
It is a foreign algorithm wearing the mask of your neighbor.
The bots are designed to make you hate each other. The actual Americans I've met just want the same things.
Something Doesn't Add Up
I'm not an economist. I'm not a policy expert.
But I'm someone who has built a life on questioning assumptions — what I call ""brules,"" the bullshit rules society programs into us without evidence.
In a ""Post-Truth"" world, b-rules thrive. They fill the void where facts used to be. So I decided to look at the actual data. And the reality I found didn't match the stories I'd been told.
Here are four ideas worth reexamining.
1. On the Economy:
I always heard that one party was better for business, better for the stock market, better for jobs. It seemed obvious. Everyone repeated it.
Then I looked at the record.
Since 1933, the stock market has performed more than twice as well under Democratic presidents (NYU / Stock Market Historical Review).
Job creation has been nearly double.
And 10 of the last 11 recessions began under Republican administrations.
I'm not sharing this to score political points. I'm saying: the story I was told was a ""brule."" It didn't match reality.
1. On Immigration:

I was told immigrants were driving crime and draining resources.
But study after study shows the opposite.
Texas — a state at the center of the immigration debate — found that native-born Americans commit violent crimes at nearly twice the rate of undocumented immigrants (Texas Dept. of Public Safety, 2024).
And in 2022 alone, undocumented immigrants paid $96.7 billion in taxes (ITEP, 2024).
They pay billions. They work in agriculture, construction, elder care, childcare — industries that would collapse without them. Many can't even claim refunds on the taxes they pay.
So if they're not causing crime… and they're not draining your taxes…
Why have we been taught to fear them?
Who benefits when we are afraid of the most vulnerable among us?
1. On Healthcare: The Freedom to Fail
530,000.
That is the number of American families who go bankrupt every year due to medical bills.
In Canada: zero.
In Germany: zero.
In the U.K., France, Japan, Australia: virtually zero.
This isn't because Americans are sicker. It's because of choices—policy choices made by people who benefit from the status quo.
But here is the ""Brule"" (the Bullshit Rule) we’ve been taught: Safety nets make people lazy.
The data shows the exact opposite.
Countries with robust social safety nets—like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark—are actually hotbeds for entrepreneurship. Sweden, for example, produces more ""unicorn"" billion-dollar tech companies per capita than any other region in the world except Silicon Valley.
Why?
Because entrepreneurship requires risk. And it is much easier to take a risk—to quit your job, start that company, or invent that product—when you know that failure doesn't mean your children will starve or you’ll lose your home if you get sick.
In America, ""freedom"" often means the freedom to fall through the cracks.
In Social Democracies, the government provides a trampoline.
When you don't have to worry about losing your healthcare because you left your corporate job, you are free to be brave.

1. On the American Dream: A Personal Warning
2. 
I was always told America has the highest upward mobility in the world—that this is the only place where anyone, from any background, can make it to the top.
It is a beautiful story. But I decided to look at the rankings.
The Global Social Mobility Index ranks countries on how easy it is for a person to start at zero and climb to the top.
The United States ranks 27th.
The top of the list? Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden.
The ""American Dream"" is now statistically more likely to happen in Scandinavia than in America.
So why do we resist the very policies that would fix this?
I believe it is because Americans have been manipulated into confusing ""Social Democracy"" with ""Communism.""
And I need to make a distinction here that is deeply personal to me.
I am an entrepreneur. I love entrepreneurs. And I hate Communism with a fire that comes from my own blood.
The Estonian side of my family owned a farm on the Baltic island of Hiiumaa for hundreds of years. But when the Communists took control of Estonia in the 1940s, that legacy was shattered.
They sent a massive portion of the Estonian population to the gulags. My children's great-grandparents were marched into a forest, lined up, and shot in the head. They were buried in unmarked graves.
Their sin? They were farmers who happened to own their own land.
This is a scar on my family’s history. That land was stolen, and it was only returned to us in the early 1990s when Estonia finally threw off the shackles of Communism and property ownership was legal again.
So you can imagine how I feel when I hear Americans screaming the word ""Communism"" at things that are clearly not Communism.
I know what Communism is. I know the smell of the graves it digs.
And I need you to know: A safety net is not Communism.
We need to understand the difference between three very different things:
1. Communism: The government owns everything. They shoot you for owning a farm. (Think Soviet Estonia).
2. Socialism: The government owns the means of production.
3. Social Democracy: The government provides a floor so that capitalism can thrive. (Think modern Europe).
The tragedy is that by fearing the ghost of Communism, Americans have rejected the very systems that would make their capitalism stronger.
You can't take big risks if the system is designed to crush you for stumbling.
When I look at my family’s history, I know that Communism destroys the human spirit. But I also know that unbridled capitalism, without a safety net, breaks the human body.
Real freedom requires a floor you can't fall through.
The Scripture I Can't Stop Thinking About

After Wyoming, I took Hayden to Ellis Island.
We stood at the base of the Statue of Liberty and read the famous inscription: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...""
I thought about my own family — immigrants who came to Malaysia with nothing. I thought about the families at the rodeo, many of whose ancestors arrived the same way, chasing the same dream.
Then I remembered these words from Jesus:
""I was a stranger and you welcomed me."" (Matthew 25:35)
""Whatever you did for the least of these, you did for me."" (Matthew 25:40)
I'm not a theologian. But those verses haunted me on that island.
I started wondering: What would it mean to take them seriously — not as a political slogan, but as a genuine challenge to how we treat the desperate?
Christ didn't say: Fear the foreigner. Blame the stranger. Build walls and turn the desperate into demons.
So how did so many good people of faith end up cheering for rhetoric that seems to contradict the teacher they follow?
I don't ask this to judge. I ask because the contradiction breaks my heart.
The Real Enemies Are Not Each Other
If I could share one insight from an outsider looking in with love, it would be this:
The veteran in Wyoming and the activist in Oakland are not enemies. They are prisoners in the same cell, fighting over crumbs while the warden laughs.
The immigrant picking strawberries didn't move your factory overseas.
The college student protesting injustice didn't write the tax code that lets billionaires pay lower rates than nurses.
The single mother on food stamps didn't create a healthcare system that charges $800 for insulin that costs $8 to make.
Your frustration is real.
But the target you've been given is wrong.
And while you are fighting your neighbor, the systems that squeeze you keep squeezing.
What I'm Asking
I'm not asking you to change your vote.
I'm not asking you to abandon your values.
I'm not asking you to agree with me.
I'm asking something simpler:
Be suspicious of anyone who tells you to hate.
Be suspicious of the media that makes you angry every single day — because anger is profitable, and you are the product.
Be suspicious of leaders who need enemies more than they need solutions.
And ask yourself, honestly:
Is my life actually better under the policies I support?
Are my bills lower?
Is my healthcare more affordable?
Are my wages keeping up?
Do my children have more opportunity than I did?
If the answer is no — then maybe, just maybe, you've been convinced to fight the wrong battles.
I dream of an America that finally lives up to its own giant story.
That dream doesn't belong to the left or the right.
It belongs to anyone willing to fight for it.
Not fight each other.
Fight for each other.
PS: If this article stirred something in you — agreement, discomfort, clarity, anything — leave a comment on the blog. Honest dialogue is how we start healing what’s been broken. I’d love to hear your thoughts.


The Truth Is One Search Away

I am not asking you to take my word for any of this. In fact, I am asking you not to.
We live in an age where the sum of human knowledge is in your pocket, yet we are often content to let cable news tell us what to think.
So, before you cast your next vote, I have a challenge for you.
Step out of the algorithm. Ignore the pundits. Open a blank browser window and do your own fact-checking.
Here are the four questions you need to ask:
1. On the Economy:
Research this: ""Which party is better for the US economy historically?"" or ""US GDP growth by president party since 1960.""
Look at who actually reduces the deficit and who balloons it. The answer will surprise you.
2. On Immigration:
Research this: ""Immigrant crime rates vs native-born citizens US"" and ""Economic contribution of undocumented immigrants.""
Ask yourself: If they are paying billions in taxes and committing fewer crimes than citizens, who benefits from making me afraid of them?
3. On Healthcare:
Research this: ""Healthcare cost per capita by country"" and ""Medical bankruptcy rates US vs Europe.""
Ask yourself: Why do other capitalist nations pay half as much as we do for better outcomes?
4. On the American Dream:
Google this: ""Global Social Mobility Index rankings"" and ""Difference between Communism, Social Democracy, and Democratic Socialism.""
Find out where the United States actually sits (Spoiler: We are #27). And find out if the policies you fear are actually the ones that would save the American Dream.
Don't let them play you.
Don't let the outrage machine win.
We are all Americans—or in my case, a friend who deeply loves America—and we are all in this together.
Let’s start fighting for each other again.
With love and respect,
Vishen

Humans Want Humans: The New Era of Entrepreneurship in the Age of AI
By Vishen Lakhiani

We are living through one of the strangest moments in the history of the internet.
AI is now generating more content in a single day than humans produced in the first decade of social media. Blog posts. Captions. Videos. Articles. Websites. Even entire “personalities” are now being created by machines.
And here’s the wild thing:

All this AI-generated content is now being fed back into the AI models. 
Which then produces even more AI-generated content.
Which then gets scraped and recycled again.
A feedback loop of synthetic ideas feeding synthetic ideas feeding synthetic ideas.
A perpetual motion machine of digital junk.
And the result?
The internet feels increasingly unreal.
Polished. Predictable. Hollow.
The texture of real human expression is disappearing.
People can sense it.
People can feel it.
And people are getting tired.
This is why inside Mindvalley, we have begun repeating a simple mantra in every strategic conversation:
“Humans want humans…”
In a world drowning in artificial content, humanity becomes the premium.
Realness becomes the differentiator.
Presence becomes the product.
And your personal story becomes your greatest asset.
Let me show you what I mean through three powerful shifts we’re seeing inside our own ecosystem: 
1. A Simple Story That Says Everything
This story says a lot about where the world is heading. Years ago, the late Bob Proctor recorded a beautiful Abundance Meditation in our office.

 He grabbed my old iPhone, sat down, and recorded it in one take.
You can hear a bit of room noise. It’s not “studio perfect.” But it’s Bob. Raw. Present. Human.
Recently, we tried something: We cleaned up the audio with AI. Polished it. Smoothed out the rough edges.
And our community hated it.
Emails started pouring in:
“Please bring back the old version.”
 “I want the original Bob.”
 “It sounds too clean. I lost the feeling.”
Think about that for a second.
People preferred the imperfect, slightly noisy, very human original to the AI-polished version.
That’s the era we’re stepping into.
The world has more “perfect” content than ever. But people are choosing realness, even when it’s rough around the edges.
2. The Rise of Live Learning: Why Live Teaching on Zoom Is Exploding 

A few months ago, we launched Mindvalley Academy, our new platform dedicated entirely to real-time learning with real-world teachers.
Not assistants.Not facilitators. Not pre-recorded videos shot three years ago. And absolutely nothing generated by AI.
We made a commitment: Human beings will show up LIVE to teach human beings.
And the results shocked even us.
Our first six micro-degrees that launched quietly, with almost no major campaigns — are already on track to generate close to $30 million a year.
And the student feedback has been extraordinary.
Why?
Because after consuming endless information on the internet, people are hungry for transformation.
They want the nuance of lived experience.
 They want energy in real time.
 They want to ask questions.
 They want to feel seen.
They want humans.
That’s why Mindvalley Academy worked so fast. It wasn’t because of clever AI tricks or conversion hacks.

It’s simply aligning with what the world is organically gravitating toward:

Humans want humans.
3. We sold the majority of tickets to our next event ONE YEAR in Advance…never seen anything like this in 15 years of events. 

Here’s another example.
When we quietly opened ticket sales for Mindvalley University 2026 — a full year early — something unbelievable happened.
We sold 55% of all tickets in the first three days.
This was 500% faster than any year in our history.
Why were families, entrepreneurs, students, and seekers rushing to book a transformational event in a completely different country… twelve months in advance?
The answer is simple:
People are craving in-person human connection like never before.
Here’s the truth:
No AI transcript can replicate the feeling of dancing with thousands of souls under the Estonian sunset.
No chatbot can replicate the moment a strange conversation with a stranger that turns into a lifelong friendship.
No algorithm can reproduce the magnetic energy of a teacher who walks into the room with fire in their voice and wisdom in their presence.
Mindvalley was born from this ethos:
Real humans. Real teachers. Real transformation. Real community.

That’s what’s selling out Mindvalley University (July 20-Aug 2 | Estonia).
But the real reason is simple, in a world where everything feels digital: Humans want humans.
4. The Personal Brand Awakening: Why I Removed the Mindvalley Podcast
This next part may surprise you.
A few months ago, I made a decision that shocked our team:
I took down the Mindvalley podcast.
Not because I didn’t love it or it didn’t perform.
But because the world has changed.
People don’t want to follow a podcast about a company — even if the company is beloved.
People don’t wake up thinking: “I wonder what this company has to say today.”
They wake up thinking:
“Whose perspective do I trust?”
 “Whose journey do I resonate with?”
 “Whose voice feels real to me?”
They want to follow a human being.
So instead, I shifted my energy toward the Vishen Lakhiani YouTube channel.
And here’s what happened:
My personal brand started growing faster than Mindvalley’s brand.
Not because I’m more interesting than Mindvalley.
But because founders carry something companies cannot replicate:
A heartbeat.
A journey.
A wound.
A perspective shaped by fire.
This is when something Daniel Priestley told me hit me harder than ever.
Daniel — one of the world’s leading entrepreneurship teachers and the most frequent guest on Diary of a CEO — said:
“I own seven companies. But I invest heavily in my personal brand because it drives traffic to all seven.
People follow people first.”
He’s right.
Creators. Coaches. Founders. Even CEOs of big companies. The ones who show up as humans  not as polished corporate avatars are the ones cutting through the noise.
Again, Humans want humans.
This is a fundamental truth of human psychology.
So What Does the Future Hold for Entrepreneurs and Founders?
Here are six shifts I believe every entrepreneur, coach, and creator must pay attention to — because they are coming fast, and they will reshape everything we know about influence and business.
#1. AI Will Dominate Content Which Means Information Is No Longer Your Value
We’re entering a world where anyone can publish. Anyone can “sound smart.” Anyone can generate a polished, perfect script in seconds.
So the edge is no longer what you know. The edge becomes who you are while you teach it.
Your life lessons, your original stories, your realness, these become essential.
When I record content these days, I don’t bother ensuring my hair is perfectly combed. I don’t fuss with lighting or studio setups. None of that seems to matter.
Here’s proof:


My recent clip about being stopped by the FBI at US Airport recorded while I was literally walking through a mall in Miami hit 1.5 million views.
Meanwhile, videos I film in a proper studio with full lighting setups don’t even come close.
Why? Because humans want humans.
Not polished. Not perfection. Not filters. Only Presence. Realness. Story.
#2. Your Personal Story Becomes Your Moat
In an AI-powered internet, realness becomes rare.
So embrace your imperfections, lived experience and your emotional honesty.
Your story is the new currency, your authentic brand and a major competitive advantage.
Here’s what I personally do:
I keep a digital list of stories, over 200 of them gathered from my life. Moments with spiritual teachers. Traumatic incidents from childhood. Insights that struck me while sitting with a shaman on a plant medicine journey.
I write these stories down, refine them, and reuse them in my content.
For example, the true story of Bob Proctor coming to our office (that you saw at the start of this newsletter) I’ve used that story in two newsletters. And every time, people light up. Why? Because it’s real.
Your stories are your soul’s fingerprints. AI can’t replicate them. And audiences crave them.
#3. Live Teaching Will Outperform Recorded Courses
People don’t want more videos. They want presence.
They want your eyes, your energy, your intuition responding in real time. Transformation happens live, not later.
This is why I’ve shifted almost entirely to live teaching.
I haven’t recorded a new pre-recorded program in over a year but I’ve clocked over 100 hours of live teaching on Zoom.
And the response?
 Electric.
I enjoy it more because I get to feel my audience’s energy.
 And they love it because loyalty is built through interaction, not information.
This is the future of online education:
 Real humans. Real time. Real transformation.
#4. In-Person Events, Seminars, and Workshops Will Explode
The world is starving for community.
Community isn’t a “nice to have” anymore. Community is becoming the new currency of entrepreneurship.
Whatever business you run  a restaurant, a longevity clinic, a coaching program on Instagram your secret weapon will be bringing your people together.
Engage in the comments. Host real-world meetups. Create spaces where your customers can connect with you and with each other.
Recently in London, I invited 40 students from our Manifesting Mastery program to join me for dinner. It turned into one of the most beautiful evenings I’ve had this year.
Real connection creates raving fans. Raving fans create movements. 
Movements create unstoppable businesses.
#5. Your Founder Brand Will Outperform Your Company Brand
People don’t follow logos. People follow leaders.
So yes,  create Instagram pages for each of your companies. Do the branding. Build the funnel.
But here’s the truth:
80% of your energy should go into your founder brand.
Because companies may rise and fall. But your founder brand, if you build it right, can outlive you.
Look at Bob Proctor. He passed away in 2021. Yet his content, his clips, his teachings — they’re everywhere. People are still quoting him today. A strong founder brand becomes immortal.
#6. The Future Belongs to Entrepreneurs Who Combine AI With Authenticity
Let AI make you faster. Let AI handle the repetition, the workload, the technical polish.
But let your humanity be the masterpiece. Your stories.Your scars. Your worldview. Your vibe.
That’s what makes you unforgettable.
Here’s an example:
This very section of this article is being written in collaboration with AI.
I’m pacing around my room, speaking out loud to one of my team members. It’s being recorded, transcribed, and sent directly into ChatGPT.
AI is helping me grammar check,polish, and structure this newsletter.
But every idea, every insight, every metaphor, every story is coming straight from my heart and lived experience.
This is the model. AI is the engine.
But YOU are the conductor.
And the entrepreneurs who master this synergy who blend speed with soul, efficiency with essence will lead the next decade of business.
⭐ And This Is Why We Created:
The Social Media Summit (3 Days | Jan 9-11)

With love,

Vishen

The 7 Sacred States
What I've learned about becoming truly unfuckwithable and why your goals will only match your frequency

By Vishen Lakhiani


I woke up one morning a few years ago and something was off.

On paper, everything looked great. Mindvalley was growing. The books were selling. I had a beautiful family, an incredible team, a life most people would envy.

But inside? I felt hollow. Reactive. Constantly chasing the next goal, the next milestone, the next validation.
I had spent years building something extraordinary — and I couldn't even enjoy it.
That's when I started asking a different question.
Not ""How do I achieve more?"" but ""What state am I operating from?""
That question changed everything.
""Your goals will only match your frequency.""This single insight rewired how I approach everything: business, relationships, and life itself. 


When you set goals from anxiety, you create more things to be anxious about. 
When you make decisions from confusion, you create more confusion. 
When you build from scarcity, you attract scarcity.
But when you shift the state you're operating from? Everything changes.
I've now shared this framework in seminar rooms in London, at island retreats in Mykonos, with entrepreneurs, with artists, with people who run billion-dollar companies and people just starting out.
The response is always the same:
""It makes me feel different. It makes me look at my life through a different lens. For the longest time, I've been chasing goals. Now I finally understand the truth.""

The Truth Nobody Talks About

Here it is: Most people try to change their external circumstances while operating from a broken internal state.

They set goals from anxiety and create more things to be anxious about.
They make decisions from confusion and create more confusion.
They build relationships from scarcity and attract scarcity.
Think about it. When you sit down to plan your new year, what state are you usually in?
Exhausted. Scattered. Anxious about whether things will work out. Still carrying wounds from past failures.
And from that place you try to design your dream life?
Here’s the thing: 

You don't need better goals. You need a better state. 
When you upgrade your internal operating system, your goals, decisions, and actions automatically upgrade with it. 
This is the leverage point most people miss entirely.



The ancient Greeks had a word for this ideal state: Ataraxia, a serene calmness that cannot be disturbed by external events.

I call it being unfuckwithable.
And after 22 years of studying human transformation, I've identified exactly seven internal states that create it.
The 7 Sacred States

Each one is trainable. Each one compounds the others. Together, they create a way of being that transforms not just what you achieve but who you become.
State #1 Knowingness

Understanding who you are at the deepest level.
The universe reflects who you ARE, not what you want. When you stand in your worth with unshakeable certainty, opportunities align, because you're no longer sending mixed signals to the world.

""The world cannot give you what you're not willing to claim.""
State #2 Faith 

Trusting before you have proof.
What's meant for you cannot miss you. What misses you was never yours. When you embody faith, you stop white-knuckling life, and paradoxically, that's when things start flowing.
""Doubt is just faith pointed in the wrong direction.""
State #3 Love

Generating love within and beaming it outward.
HeartMath research shows this literally changes your biology, and the biology of people around you. When you operate from love, doors open that force could never unlock.
""Love is not something you find. It's something you become.""
State #4 Stillness
Becoming the eye of the storm.
Your best ideas, clearest decisions, and deepest intuition all come from the quiet. The warrior's secret weapon isn't aggression; it's the ability to remain still when everyone else is panicking.
""The answers you seek are already within you. They're just waiting for you to get quiet enough to hear them.""
State #5 Non-Attachment

I want it. Working for it. But not needing it.
Steve Jobs got fired from Apple. He shrugged, started Pixar, and eventually returned to build the most valuable company on Earth. When rejection loses its sting, you become antifragile.
""Hold your dreams like water, tightly enough to carry them, loosely enough to let them flow.""
State #6 Devotion

Discipline elevated to a sacred practice.
When your work becomes worship and your commitment becomes unbreakable, you tap into a reservoir of energy that willpower alone can never access. This is the state that creates legacies.
""Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most.""
State #7 Receiving

Opening your cup and letting it fill.
Most people unconsciously block what life wants to give them. Receiving is the active practice of allowing, and it's often the missing piece for people who work hard but never get what they deserve.
""You cannot pour from an empty cup, and you cannot fill a cup you won't hold out.""
Here's what's remarkable: 

Each state amplifies the others. 

Knowingness makes Faith easier. 
Faith makes Non-Attachment natural. 
Non-Attachment opens up Receiving. 

Together, they compound into something extraordinary — a state of being that is genuinely unfuckwithable.

This is the core framework from my upcoming book, The Art of Becoming Unfuckwithable.

But the book won't be out until 2027. And I don't want you to wait that long.


The Art Of Becoming Unfuckwithable By Vishen Lakhiani

Coming 2027



My next book introduces the complete 7 Sacred States methodology. 

But you don't have to wait.

I'm going to LIVE for free to teach you the entire framework before the new year.

Why Now? 

We're about to enter a new year. And right now, millions of people are preparing to set goals, make resolutions, and try to change their lives.

Most of them will fail.

Not because they lack willpower. Because they're trying to create change from the wrong state.

What if you could enter 2025 differently?

What if, instead of setting goals from exhaustion and anxiety, you set them from Knowingness, Faith, and Stillness?

What if you approached your biggest challenges with Non-Attachment and Devotion?

What if you were finally open to Receiving everything life wants to give you?


The 7 Sacred States Challenge



Starting Tomorrow, Dec 18 till Dec 24, I'm running a free 7-day challenge where I'll guide you through each of these states, one per day.
This isn't a surface-level overview. Each day, you'll get:
- The philosophy:  the deeper meaning behind each state and why it matters.
- 
- The science:  what modern research tells us about how these states work.
- 
- The stories:  tales from history, culture, and my encounters with prominent people who embody these states, to make each lesson land.
- 
- A daily ritual:  a 10-15 minute practice you can use immediately.
- 
- Live Q&A: where I'll answer your questions directly
By December 24th, you'll have a complete toolkit for becoming unfuckwithable. And you'll enter 2025 from a state you may never have experienced before.
And I'm offering it completely free.
[Join the 7 Sacred States Challenge]

December 18-24, 2024 • Completely Free
Reset your state before you set your goals.
Here's my promise to you:
If you show up for all seven days and do the practices, you will not be the same person on December 24th that you were on December 18th.
The way you think will shift. The way you feel will shift. The way you approach your goals, your relationships, your challenges — all of it will shift.
Because you'll finally be operating from the state that makes everything else possible.
Most people will spend New Year's Eve making promises to a version of themselves that doesn't exist yet.

You? You'll already be that person.

That's the difference between hoping for change and embodying it

Don't enter 2026 the way you entered 2024.

Enter it unfuckwithable.

I'll see you tomorrow on day 1 of the challenge (Dec 18) 

Vishen
P.S: Everyone who shows up for the challenge gets my ""Knowingness Meditation"" audio, a guided practice to anchor your identity and worth. It's something I've never released publicly before. Claim your spot at the challenge here 
P.P.S. I’d love to hear from you. Which of the seven states do you feel you’re missing most right now? Share your thoughts in the comments below, I read them all.

It’s About Devotion.
Sub: The One Thing Christmas Was Trying to Teach Us
Pre: Devotion, ritual, and how ordinary moments shape who we become.

Christmas has become a moment.
A feeling we try to manufacture.
A mood we chase for a few days.
A brief pause before life speeds up again.
But if you look closely, if you strip away the lights, the gifts, the songs, the consumerism, what you find underneath Christmas is something far older, and far more powerful.
Ritual.
And ritual is how human beings have practiced devotion for thousands of years.
One of my favorite rituals happens every year without fail: putting up the Christmas tree with my kids.
I took a photo just a few nights ago. It was 1 AM. I walked into the living room and found my daughter and her best friend, who was sleeping over, mesmerized by the lights on the tree.

I think this may be my favorite picture of 2025. 
The tree wasn’t decoration.
It was a ritual.
An act of devotion.
Something we do as a family every year, not because it achieves anything—but because it anchors something. 
The Forgotten Power of Devotion
In my upcoming book, Becoming Unfuckwithable, I talk about devotion not as religion or sacrifice, but as applied love over time.
Devotion to a cause.
Devotion to an ideal.
Devotion to your health.
Devotion to your children.
Devotion to your craft.
Devotion to your inner life.
It doesn’t matter what the object of devotion is.
What matters is this:
Devotion makes us stronger because it removes negotiation.
When you are devoted, you don’t wake up asking, “Do I feel like it today?”
You wake up knowing who you are. And you act accordingly.
Why Rituals Were Never About Results
Here’s something the modern world has quietly forgotten:
Rituals are not about what you get.
They never were.
Why do we make our bed every morning, knowing full well we’re going to mess it up again at night?
Why do we spend hours choosing Christmas gifts, only to watch the wrapping paper torn apart in seconds?
Why do we hit the gym day after day, even though progress is slow, incremental, sometimes invisible?
If you look at these behaviors purely through the lens of efficiency, they make no sense.
And that’s the point.
Rituals were never designed to be efficient. 
They were designed to be formative.
They shape us.
Ritual Is Identity in Motion
Ancient cultures didn’t rely on motivation. 
They relied on structure.
You didn’t meditate when you felt inspired. 
You prayed when the bell rang.
You didn’t train when you were in the mood.
You trained because that’s what warriors did.
You didn’t ask whether a ritual was “worth it.”
You performed it because it reminded you who you were.
Ritual locks identity into the body.
And identity is far more powerful than willpower.
The Modern Trap: “What Do I Get?”
Somewhere along the way, we turned everything into a transaction.
We started asking:
What do I get from this workout?
What do I get from this relationship?
What do I get from this habit?
What do I get from this practice?
But devotion collapses the moment it becomes transactional.
Rituals don’t ask for guarantees.
They don’t promise outcomes.
They don’t negotiate with the ego.
They simply say:
Show up anyway.
And in doing so, they free us from the exhausting cycle of chasing, quitting, restarting, and judging ourselves.
Christmas as a Devotional Technology
This is why Christmas endures.
Not because of theology.
Not because of tradition.
But because, once a year, it forces ritual back into our lives.
We slow down.
We gather.
We give without keeping score.
We show up for people we love,even when it’s inconvenient.
For a brief moment, we remember what it feels like to live from devotion instead of demand.
The tragedy isn’t that Christmas ends.
The tragedy is that we don’t carry its structure forward.
A Modern Ritual for an Ancient Need
If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this:
You don’t need grand practices to become unfuckwithable.
You need small rituals you don’t negotiate with.
Five minutes of stillness each morning. A daily walk. Writing one paragraph. Preparing food with care. Training your body consistently. Showing up for your kids,fully present.
Not because it guarantees success.
But because it guarantees alignment.
And alignment compounds.
Devotion Is What Remains When Motivation Is Gone
Motivation is emotional. Emotion is unstable.
Devotion is structural. And structure outlives emotion.
This is why devotion to a practice, a value, or a way of living creates something deeper than achievement.
It creates character.
And character is what makes you unfuckwithable.
One Small Ritual to Carry Into the New Year
If there’s one thing I’d invite you to take into the new year, it’s not a goal.
It’s one small ritual.
Not something impressive.
Not something you’ll post about.
Not something that needs willpower.
Just one steady, repeatable act you don’t negotiate with.
It might be as simple as this:
- Taking your supplements every morning: unrushed, intentional, present. Not because supplements change your life, but because how you do small things trains who you are.
- 
- Sitting cross-legged on the same sofa every morning for five minutes of stillness. Same place. Same posture. Just you, breathing, showing up.
- 
- Stepping outside at 8 a.m. every day for a short walk to get sunlight. Same route. Same time. Letting your body relearn rhythm.
- 
- Writing a two-minute note of appreciation to one colleague or teammate before you start your workday. No agenda. No feedback. Just acknowledgement.
- 
None of these rituals will go viral.
None of them will look dramatic.
And that’s exactly why they work.
Because devotion doesn’t need intensity. It needs consistency.
The ritual isn’t about what it produces. The ritual is the point.
Show up for it long enough, and something subtle but powerful begins to happen:
your nervous system calms, your identity stabilizes, and life starts to feel less like something you’re chasing, and more like something you’re inhabiting.
That’s how change really happens.
 Quietly.
 Daily.
 Without applause.
So this Christmas, instead of resolutions, try something different.
Choose one small ritual.
Make it steady.
Make it repeatable.
Make it unyielding.
Not to get something.
But to be someone.
That’s devotion.
And devotion, practiced quietly, daily, without applause, is how ordinary humans become extraordinary.
Merry Christmas. May you remember who you are and rise.

3 New Year Lessons I Wish Someone Told Me When I Was 30.
By Vishen Lakhiani

I used to think something was wrong with me.
I’d set a goal.
I’d feel inspired.
I’d make a plan.
And then somewhere between Day 7 and Day 21, I’d fall off.
Miss a workout.
Skip a meditation.
Eat the cookie.
Ghost the vision.
And then came the familiar spiral:
“Why can’t I just be consistent?”
 “Other people seem to have more discipline than me.”
 “Maybe I’m just wired wrong.”
Here’s what I didn’t realize at the time:
The problem wasn’t my discipline. It was my mental framework.
After 22 years of studying human behavior, I discovered three distinctions that quietly change everything about how goals actually work.
Not hustle hacks. Not productivity tricks. Not morning routines with ice baths and lion’s mane.
Just three simple shifts in how you relate to growth.
So as we step into 2026, I want to share three distinctions that completely changed how I approach goals, growth, and becoming who we’re meant to be.
Once you see them, you can’t unsee them.
Distinction #1: Baseline vs. Peak
(Why your best days are sabotaging your life)
Here’s the first mistake almost everyone makes with goals:
They design for their best days instead of their baseline.
Most goals are set during moments of peak motivation:
- New Year’s Eve
- 
- After a powerful event
- 
- Right after a bad week when you swear “never again”
So you write goals that require peak performance:
“I’ll work out six days a week.”
 “I’ll wake up at 5 a.m. every day.”
 “I’ll meditate for an hour every morning.”
And then… life shows up.
Stress. Travel. Kids. Exhaustion.
The peak fades.
When that happens, peak-based goals don’t inspire us, they shame us.

The solution is to design goals around your baseline: your sustainable default. 

Not the life you can maintain when everything is perfect, but the life you can maintain when things are hard.
A Personal Example
Years ago, I set a goal to meditate for one hour every morning.
On my best days, I did it. On most days? Zero minutes.
Why? Because if I couldn’t do the full hour, my mind said, “Why bother?”
When I shifted to baseline thinking, I changed my goal to 15 minutes a day.
15 minutes was non-negotiable. On good days, I did more. On terrible days, I still did at least 15 mins. 
And something surprising happened.
The Lesson: Lowering your minimum actually raises your average.
When your baseline holds, you never “fall off.” You never restart. And consistency compounds.
Distinction #2: Direction vs. Perfection
(Why clarity beats certainty every time)
The second distinction explains why so many brilliant people feel stuck.
They believe they need perfect clarity before they can start.
The perfect career.
The perfect partner.
The perfect plan.
But here’s what Lifebook taught me:
Clarity doesn’t come from thinking.
It comes from moving.
Perfection feels productive, but it’s actually paralyzing.
Perfection says:
- “Figure everything out first.”
- 
- “Make the perfect plan.”
- 
- “Don’t move until you’re sure.”
- 
Direction says something very different:
- “This way.”
- 
- “Not that way.”
- 
- “Let’s adjust as we go.”


When I did Mindvalley’s Lifebook program something was revealed to me:
Direction creates calm. Perfection creates anxiety.
When you know the direction you’re heading, even if the details are fuzzy, your nervous system relaxes.
Your body goes: “Okay. We’re not lost.”
That’s why one phrase matters so much here:
You don’t need certainty.
You need a direction your body agrees with.
Your body knows before your spreadsheet does.
- Contraction, heaviness, resistance? That’s data.
- 
- Grounded, energized, quietly “yes”? Also data.
- 
Direction is enough. Think of it like driving at night. Your headlights don’t show the whole road, just enough to keep moving. And as you move, more of the road appears.
The Lesson:  Don’t ask: “What’s the perfect destination?” Ask: “Am I generally moving in the right direction?”
That’s how momentum is born.
Distinction #3: Correction vs. Self-Judgment
(The difference between mastery and misery)
This may be the most important distinction of all.
Because you will slip.
You will miss days.
You will drift.
The question isn’t if that happens.
The question is: what do you do next?
For most of my life, missing a goal triggered self-judgment.
Not data. A verdict.
And here’s the irony:
Self-judgment doesn’t motivate change. It trains avoidance.
Your nervous system learns: “This pursuit = pain.”

I once heard someone describe mastery as ""the rate of correction, not the absence of error."" That reframed everything for me.
Masters aren't people who never fail. They're people who fail, notice, adjust, and continue, faster than everyone else. Their secret isn't perfection. It's rapid, shame-free correction.
They’re people who:
- Notice quickly
- 
- Adjust calmly
- 
- Continue without drama
- 
Consistency isn’t heroic. It’s mechanical.
You missed a workout? That's not proof that you're lazy. It's data. What got in the way? What could you adjust? How might you make it easier next time?
You broke your diet? That's not proof that you lack willpower. It's feedback. What was happening emotionally? What need were you trying to meet? How can you meet that need differently?
Correction is clinical. Curious. Kind. It says: ""Interesting. Let me adjust and continue.""
Self-judgment is emotional. Harsh. Final. It says: ""See? I knew I couldn't do this.""
The Lesson: When you fall short, ask: “What can I learn and adjust?” Never ask: “What’s wrong with me?”
Correction creates momentum.
Judgment creates quicksand.


What These Three Distinctions Add Up To
Most people don’t fail at goals because they lack motivation or intelligence.
They fail because they’re using the wrong mental models.
- They design for peaks instead of baselines
- 
- They demand perfection instead of direction
- 
- They choose judgment instead of correction
Shift these three distinctions, and everything changes.
Not through force. But through alignment.
So as you step into 2026, here’s my New Year’s wish for you:
Be kinder with your baseline.
Trust direction over certainty.
Correct faster and judge less.
You’re not behind. You’re not broken.
You were just never taught the real rules of the game.
Happy New Year. Here’s to an extraordinary 2026.
A Question for You: If you were to redesign one area of your life, not for peaks, not for perfection, not for judgment, but for: a livable baseline, a direction your body trusts, and fast, gentle correction. 
What would change first? Let me know in the comment section of this blog.
That question alone might be the beginning of your next chapter.
Your Next Step for 2026 to be the best year yet:
If these 3 distinctions landed for you, there’s a reason. An Insight creates awareness. But change begins when awareness meets structure.
That’s why Jon & Missy Butcher created Lifebook: not as a goal-setting system, but as a way to design your life around a livable baseline, a clear direction, and continuous, judgment-free correction.
If you want 2026 to be different, start the year with clarity, now.

Whatever you choose, remember this: You don’t need to become someone new. 
You just need a system that supports who you already are becoming.
With love,
